# go/bundle
This directory contains a reference implementation of [Bundled HTTP Exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html) spec.

## Overview
We currently provide three command-line tools: `gen-bundle`, `sign-bundle` and `dump-bundle`.

`gen-bundle` command is a bundle generator tool. `gen-bundle` consumes a set of http exchanges (currently in the form of [HAR format](https://w3c.github.io/web-performance/specs/HAR/Overview.html), URL list file, or static files in a local directory), and emits a bundled exchange file.

`sign-bundle` command attaches a signature to a bundle. `sign-bundle` takes an existing bundle file, a certificate and a private key, and emits a new bundle file with cryptographic signature for the bundled exchanges added.

`dump-bundle` command is a bundle inspector tool. `dump-bundle` dumps the enclosed http exchanges of a given bundled exchange file in a human readable form.

You are also welcome to use the code as golang lib (e.g. `import "github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/bundle"`), but please be aware that the API is not yet stable and is subject to change any time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
golang environment needs to be set up in prior to using the tool. We are testing the tool on latest golang. Please refer to [Go Getting Started documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install) for the details.

### Installation
We recommend using `go get` to install the command-line tool.

```
go get -u github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/bundle/cmd/...
```

## Usage

### gen-bundle
`gen-bundle` generates a bundled exchange file. There are three ways to provide a set of exchanges to bundle; by a HAR file, by a URL list, and by a local directory.

These command-line flags are common to all the three options:

- `-primaryURL` specifies the bundle's main resource URL. This URL is also used as the fallback destination when browser cannot process the bundle.
- `-manifestURL` specifies the bundle's [manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/) URL.
- `-o` specifies name of the output bundle file.
- `-headerOverride` adds additional response header to all bundled responses. Existing values of the header are overwritten.

#### From a HAR file

One convenient way to generate HAR file is via Chrome Devtools. Navigate to "Network" panel, and right-click on any resource and select "Save as HAR with content".
![generating har with devtools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WICG/webpackage/master/go/bundle/har-devtools.png)

Once you have the har file, generate the bundled exchange file via:
```
gen-bundle -har foo.har -o foo.wbn -primaryURL https://example.com/
```

#### From a URL list

`gen-bundle` also accepts `-URLList FILE` flag. `FILE` is a plain text file with one URL on each line. `gen-bundle` fetches these URLs and put the responses into the bundle. For example, you could create `urls.txt` with:

```
# A line starting with '#' is a comment.
https://example.com/
https://example.com/manifest.webmanifest
https://example.com/style.css
https://example.com/script.js
```
then run:
```
gen-bundle -URLList urls.txt \
           -primaryURL https://example.com/ \
           -manifestURL https://example.com/manifest.webmanifest \
           -o example_com.wbn
```

Note that `gen-bundle` does not automatically discover subresources; you have to enumerate all the necessary subresources in the URL list file.

#### From a local directory

You can also create a bundle from a local directory. For example, if you have the necessary files for the site `https://www.example.com/` in `static/` directory, run:
```
gen-bundle -dir static -baseURL https://example.com/ -o foo.wbn -primaryURL https://example.com/
```

### sign-bundle
`sign-bundle` updates a bundle attaching a cryptographic signature of its exchanges. To use this tool, you need a pair of a private key and a certificate in the `application/cert-chain+cbor` format. See [go/signedexchange](../signedexchange/README.md) for more information on how to create a key and certificate pair.

Assuming you have a key and certificate pair for `example.org`, this command will sign all exchanges in `unsigned.wbn` whose URL's hostname is `example.org`, and writes a new bundle to `signed.wbn`.

```
sign-bundle \
  -i unsigned.wbn \
  -certificate cert.cbor \
  -privateKey priv.key \
  -validityUrl https://example.org/resource.validity.msg \
  -o signed.wbn
```

### dump-bundle
`dump-bundle` dumps the content of a bundled exchange in a human readable form. To display content of a bundle file, invoke:
```
dump-bundle -i foo.wbn
```

## Using Bundles
Bundles generated with `gen-bundle` can be opened with web browsers supporting web bundles.

Chrome (79+) experimentally supports Web Bundles with some limitations. See [this document](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/master/content/browser/web_package/using_web_bundles.md) for more details.
