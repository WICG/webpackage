# js/bundle
This directory contains a JavaScript library for serializing (and parsing, in the future) the `application/webbundle` format defined in the [Bundled HTTP Exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html) draft spec.

Currently this library doesn't support origin-signed exchanges, but bundles generated by this library can be signed with the [`sign-bundle`](../../go/bundle/README.md#sign-bundle) Go tool.

## Installation
Using npm:
```bash
npm install wicg-webbundle
```

## Usage
Please be aware that the API is not yet stable and is subject to change any time.

Example:
```javascript
const webbundle = require('wicg-webbundle');
const fs = require("fs");

const primaryURL = 'https://example.com/';
let builder = new webbundle.BundleBuilder(primaryURL);
builder.setManifestURL('https://example.com/manifest.json');
builder.addExchange(
    primaryURL,                          // URL
    200,                                 // response code
    {'Content-Type': 'text/html'},       // response headers
    '<html>Hello, Web Bundle!</html>');  // response body (string or Uint8Array)
// Have as many builder.addExchange() for resource URLs as needed for the package.

fs.writeFileSync('out.wbn', builder.createBundle());
```
