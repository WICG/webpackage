--- abstract

This document explores how a server can send particular responses that are
authoritative for an origin, when the server itself is not authoritative for
that origin. For now, it focuses on the constraints covering any such mechanism.

# Introduction

When
I
[presented Web Packaging to DISPATCH](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-99-dispatch/),
folks thought it would make sense to split it into a way to sign individual HTTP
responses as coming from a particular origin, and separately a way to bundle a
collection of HTTP responses. This document explores the constraints on any
method of signing HTTP responses and briefly sketches a possible solution to the
constraints.

# Terminology

Author
: The entity that controls the server for a particular origin {{?RFC6454}}. The
  author can get a CA to issue certificates for their private keys and can run a
  TLS server for their origin.

Intermediate
: An entity that fetches signed HTTP responses from an author or another
  intermediate and forwards them to another intermediate or a client.

Client
: An entity that uses a signed HTTP response and needs to be able to prove that
  the author vouched for it as coming from its claimed origin.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Use cases

## PUSHed subresources {#uc-pushed-subresources}

To reduce round trips, a server might use HTTP/2 PUSH to inject a subresource
from another server into the client's cache. If anything about the subresource
is expired or can't be verified, the client would fetch it from the original
server.

For example, if `https://example.com/index.html` includes

~~~html
<script src="https://jquery.com/jquery-1.2.3.min.js">
~~~

Then to avoid the need to look up and connect to `jquery.com` in the critical
path, `example.com` might PUSH that resource ({{?RFC7540}}, section 8.2), signed
by `jquery.com`.

## Explicit use of a CDN for subresources {#uc-explicit-cdn}

In order to speed up loading but still maintain control over its content, an
HTML page in a particular origin `O.com` could tell clients to load its
subresources from an intermediate CDN that's not authoritative, but require that
those resources be signed by `O.com` so that the CDN couldn't modify the
resources.

~~~html
<img logicalsrc="https://O.com/img.png"
     physicalsrc="https://cdn.com/O.com/img.png">
~~~

To make it easier to configure the right CDN for a given request, computation of
the `physicalsrc` could be encapsulated in a custom element:

~~~html
<cdn-img src="https://O.com/img.png"></cdn-img>
~~~

where the `<cdn-img>` implementation generates an appropriate `<img>` based on,
for example, a `<meta name="cdn-base">` tag elsewhere in the page.

This could be used for some of the same purposes as SRI ({{uc-sri}}).

## Subresource Integrity {#uc-sri}

The W3C WebAppSec group is investigating
[using signatures](https://github.com/mikewest/signature-based-sri) in {{SRI}}.
They need a way to transmit the signature with the response, which this proposal
could provide.

However, their needs also differ in some significant ways:

1. The `integrity="ed25519-[public-key]"` attribute and CSP-based ways of
   expressing a public key don't need the signing key to be also trusted to sign
   arbitrary content for an origin.
2. Some uses of SRI want to constrain subresources to be vouched for by a
   third-party, rather than just being signed by the subresource's author.

While we can design this system to cover both origin-trusted and simple-key
signatures, we should check that this is better than having two separate systems
for the two kinds of signatures.

Note that while the current proposal for SRI describes signing only the content
of a
resource,
[they may need to sign its name as well, to prevent security vulnerabilities](https://github.com/mikewest/signature-based-sri/issues/5).
The details of what they need to sign will affect whether and how they can use
this proposal.

## Offline websites {#uc-offline-websites}

See <https://github.com/WICG/webpackage> and
{{?I-D.yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging}}. This use requires origin-signed
resources to be bundled.

# Requirements and open questions

## Proof of origin

To verify that a thing came from a particular origin, for use in the same
context as a TLS connection, we need someone to vouch for the signing key with
as much verification as the signing keys used in TLS. The obvious way to do this
is to re-use the web PKI and CA ecosystem.

### Certificate constraints

If we re-use existing TLS server certificates, we incur the risks that:

1. TLS server certificates must be accessible from online servers, so they're
   easier to steal than an offline key. A package's signing key doesn't need to
   be online.
2. A server using an origin-trusted key for one purpose (e.g. TLS) might
   accidentally sign something that looks like a package, or vice versa.

If these risks are too high, we could define a new Extended Key Usage
({{?RFC5280}}, section 4.2.1.12) that requires CAs to issue new keys for this
purpose or a new certificate extension to do the same. A new EKU would probably
require CAs to also issue new intermediate certificates because of how browsers
trust EKUs. Both an EKU and a new extension take a long time to deploy and allow
CAs to charge package-signers more than normal server operators, which will
reduce adoption.

The rest of this document will assume we can re-use existing TLS server
certificates.

### Signature constraints

In order to prevent an attacker who can convince the server to sign some
resource from causing those signed bytes to be interpreted as something else,
signatures here need to:

1. Avoid key types that are used for non-TLS protocols whose output could be
   confused with a signature. That may be just the `rsaEncryption` OID from
   {{?RFC2437}}.
2. Use the same format as TLS's signatures, specified in {{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}
   section 4.4.3, with a context string that's specific to this use.

The specification also needs to define which signing algorithm to use. I expect
to define that as a function from the key type, instead of allowing
attacker-controlled data to specify it.

### Retrieving the certificate {#certificate-chain}

The client needs to be able to find the certificate vouching for the signing
key, a chain from that certificate to a trusted root, and possibly other trust
information like SCTs ({{?RFC6962}}). One approach would be to include the
certificate and its chain in the signature metadata itself, but this wastes
bytes when the same certificate is used for multiple HTTP responses. If we
decide to put the signature in an HTTP header, certificates are also unusually
large for that context.

Another option is to pass a URL that the client can fetch to retrieve the
certificate and chain. To avoid extra round trips in fetching that URL, it could
be [bundled](#uc-offline-websites) with the signed content
or [PUSHed](#uc-pushed-subresources) with it. The risks from the
`client_certificate_url` extension ({{RFC6066}} section 11.3) don't seem to
apply here, since an attacker who can get a client to load a package and fetch
the certificates it references, can also get the client to perform those fetches
by loading other HTML.

To avoid using an unintended certificate with the same public key as the
intended one, the content of the certificate chain should be included in the
signed data, like TLS does ({{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, section 4.4.3).

## How much to sign

The previous {{?I-D.thomson-http-content-signature}} and
{{?I-D.burke-content-signature}} schemes signed just the content, while
({{?I-D.cavage-http-signatures}} could also sign the response headers and the
request method and path. However, the same path, response headers, and content
may mean something very different when retrieved from a different server, so
this document expects to include the whole URL in the signed data as well.

The question of whether to include other request headers---primarily the
`accept*` family---is still open. These headers need to be represented so that
clients wanting a different language, say, can avoid using the wrong-language
response, but it's not obvious that there's a security vulnerability if an
attacker can spoof them. That said, it's always safer to include everything in
the signature.

In order to allow multiple clients to consume the same signed response, the
response shouldn't include the exact headers that any particular client sends.
For example, a Japanese resource wouldn't include

~~~http
accept-language: ja-JP, ja;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, zh;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
~~~

Instead, it would probably include just

~~~http
accept-language: ja-JP, ja
~~~

and clients would use the same matching logic as
for [PUSH_PROMISE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.2) frame
headers.

The rest of this document will assume that all request headers are included in
the signature.

## Response lifespan

A normal HTTPS response is authoritative only for one client, for as long as its
cache headers say it should live. A signed response can be re-used for many
clients, and if it was generated while a server was compromised, it can continue
compromising clients even if their requests happen after the server recovers.
This signing scheme needs to mitigate that risk.

### Certificate revocation

Certificates are mis-issued and private keys are stolen, and in response clients
need to be able to stop trusting these certificates as promptly as possible.
Online revocation
checks [don't work](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html), so
the industry has moved to pushed revocation lists and stapled OCSP responses
{{?RFC6066}}.

Pushed revocation lists work as-is to block trust in the certificate signing a
response, but the signatures need an explicit strategy to staple OCSP responses.
One option is to extend the certificate download ({{certificate-chain}}) to
include the OCSP response too, perhaps in the
[TLS 1.3 CertificateEntry](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-tls13.html#ocsp-and-sct) format.

### Response downgrade attacks {#downgrade}

The signed content in a response might be vulnerable to attacks, such as XSS, or
might simply be discovered to be incorrect after publication. Once the author
fixes those vulnerabilities or mistakes, clients should stop trusting the old
signed content in a reasonable amount of time. Similar to certificate
revocation, I expect the best option to be stapled "this version is still valid"
assertions with short expiration times.

These assertions could be structured as:

1. A signed minimum version number or timestamp for a set of request headers:
   This requires that signed responses need to include a version number or
   timestamp, but allows a server to provide a single signature covering all
   valid versions.
2. A replacement for the whole response's signature. This requires the author to
   separately re-sign each valid version and requires each version to include a
   strong validator {{?RFC7232}}, but allows intermediates to serve less data.
3. A replacement for the response's signature and an update for the embedded
   `expires` and related cache-control HTTP headers {{?RFC7234}}. This naturally
   extends authors' intuitions about cache expiration and the existing cache
   revalidation behavior to signed responses. However, it also requires that the
   update procedure for the response headers on the client must produce
   something that's bytewise identical to the updated headers on the server.

The signature also needs to include instructions to intermediates for how to
fetch updated validity assertions.

## Conveying the signed headers

HTTP headers are traditionally munged by proxies, making it impossible to
guarantee that the client will see the same sequence of bytes as the author
wrote. In the HTTPS world, we have more end-to-end header integrity, but it's
still likely that there are enough TLS-terminating proxies that the author's
signatures would tend to break before getting to the client.

Since proxies don't modify unknown content types, I expect to propose an
`application/http2` format to serialize the request headers, response headers,
and body so they can be signed. This could be as simple as a series of HTTP/2
frames, or could

1. Allow longer contiguous bodies than
   [HTTP/2's 16MB frame limit](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-4.2), and
2. Use better compression than {{?RFC7541}} for the non-confidential headers.
   Note that header compression can probably share a compression state across a
   single signed request/response pair, but probably cannot use any compression
   state from other responses.

To help the PUSHed subresources use case ({{uc-pushed-subresources}}), we might
also want to extend the `PUSH_PROMISE` frame type to include a signature, and
then there might be some way to include the request headers directly in that
frame.

# Straw proposal

TBD

# Security considerations

Authors MUST NOT include confidential information in a signed response that an
untrusted intermediate could forward, since the response is only signed and not
encrypted. Intermediates can read the content.

Relaxing the requirement to consult DNS when determining authority for an origin
means that an attacker who possesses a valid certificate no longer needs to be
on-path to redirect traffic to them; instead of modifying DNS, they need only
convince the user to visit another Web site in order to serve responses signed
as the target. This consideration and mitigations for it are shared by
{{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-origin-frame}}.

Signing a bad response can affect more users than simply serving a bad response,
since a served response will only affect users who make a request while the bad
version is live, while an attacker can forward a signed response until its
signature expires. Authors should consider shorter signature expiration times
than they use for cache expiration times.

An attacker with temporary access to a signing oracle can sign "still valid"
assertions with arbitrary timestamps and expiration times. As a result, when a
signing oracle is removed, the keys it provided access to SHOULD be revoked so
that, even if the attacker used them to sign future-dated package validity
assertions, the key's OCSP assertions will expire, causing the package as a
whole to become untrusted.

# Privacy considerations

Normally, when a client fetches `https://o1.com/resource.js`,
`o1.com` learns that the client is interested in the resource. If
`o1.com` signs `resource.js`, `o2.com` serves it as
`https://o2.com/o1resource.js`, and the client fetches it from there,
then `o2.com` learns that the client is interested, and if the client
executes the Javascript, that could also report the client's interest back to
`o1.com`.

Often, `o2.com` already knew about the client's interest, because it's the
entity that directed the client to `o1resource.js`, but there may be cases where
this leaks extra information.

For non-executable resource types, a signed response can improve the privacy
situation by hiding the client's interest from the original author.
