--- abstract

This document specifies how a server can send an HTTP exchange---a request
URL, content negotiation information, and a response---with signatures that
vouch for that exchange's
authenticity. These signatures can be verified against an origin's certificate
to establish that the exchange is authoritative for an origin even if it was
transferred over a connection that isn't. The signatures can also be used in
other ways described in the appendices.

These signatures contain countermeasures against downgrade and
protocol-confusion attacks.

# Introduction

Signed HTTP exchanges provide a way to prove the authenticity of a resource in
cases where the transport layer isn't sufficient. This can be used in several
ways:

* When signed by a certificate ({{?RFC5280}}) that's trusted for an origin, an
  exchange can be treated as authoritative for that origin, even if it was
  transferred over a connection that isn't authoritative (Section 9.1 of
  {{?RFC7230}}) for that origin. See {{uc-pushed-subresources}} and
  {{uc-explicit-distributor}}.
* A top-level resource can use a public key to identify an expected publisher for
  particular subresources, a system known as Subresource Integrity ({{SRI}}). An
  exchange's signature provides the matching proof of authorship. See
  {{uc-sri}}.
* A signature can vouch for the exchange in some way, for example that it
  appears in a transparency log or that static analysis indicates that it omits
  certain attacks. See {{uc-transparency}} and {{uc-static-analysis}}.

Subsequent work toward the use cases in {{?I-D.yasskin-webpackage-use-cases}}
will provide a way to group signed exchanges into bundles that can be
transmitted and stored together, but single signed exchanges are useful enough
to standardize on their own.

# Terminology {#terminology}

Absolute URL
: A string for which the [URL
 parser](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-parser) ({{URL}}), when run
 without a base URL, returns a URL rather than a failure, and for which that URL
 has a null fragment. This is similar to the [absolute-URL
 string](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string) concept defined by
 ({{URL}}) but might not include exactly the same strings.

Author
: The entity that wrote the content in a particular resource. This specification
  deals with publishers rather than authors.

Publisher
: The entity that controls the server for a particular origin {{?RFC6454}}. The
  publisher can get a CA to issue certificates for their private keys and can
  run a TLS server for their origin.

Exchange (noun)
: An HTTP request URL, content negotiation information, and an HTTP response.
  This can be encoded into a request message from a client with its matching
  response from a server, into the request in a PUSH_PROMISE with its matching
  response stream, or into the dedicated format in
  {{application-signed-exchange}}, which uses {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}} to
  encode the content negotiation information. This is not quite the same meaning
  as defined by Section 8 of {{?RFC7540}}, which assumes the content negotiation
  information is embedded into HTTP request headers.

Intermediate
: An entity that fetches signed HTTP exchanges from a publisher or another
  intermediate and forwards them to another intermediate or a client.

Client
: An entity that uses a signed HTTP exchange and needs to be able to prove that
  the publisher vouched for it as coming from its claimed origin.

Unix time
: Defined by {{POSIX}} [section
4.16](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Signing an exchange # {#proposal}

In the response of an HTTP exchange the server MAY include a `Signature` header
field ({{signature-header}}) holding a list of one or more parameterised
signatures that vouch for the content of the exchange. Exactly which content the
signature vouches for can depend on how the exchange is transferred
({{transfer}}).

The client categorizes each signature as "valid" or "invalid" by validating that
signature with its certificate or public key and other metadata against the
exchange's URL, response headers, and content ({{signature-validity}}). This
validity then informs higher-level protocols.

Each signature is parameterised with information to let a client fetch assurance
that a signed exchange is still valid, in the face of revoked certificates and
newly-discovered vulnerabilities. This assurance can be bundled back into the
signed exchange and forwarded to another client, which won't have to re-fetch
this validity information for some period of time.

## The Signature Header ## {#signature-header}

The `Signature` header field conveys a list of signatures for an exchange, each
one accompanied by information about how to determine the authority of and
refresh that signature. Each signature directly signs the exchange's URL and
response headers and identifies one of those headers that enforces the integrity
of the exchange's payload.

The `Signature` header is a Structured Header as defined by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be a parameterised list
(Section 3.4 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}). Its ABNF is:

    Signature = sh-param-list

Each parameterised identifier in the list MUST have parameters named "sig",
"integrity", "validity-url", "date", and "expires". Each parameterised identifier
MUST also have either "cert-url" and "cert-sha256" parameters or an "ed25519key"
parameter. This specification gives no meaning to the identifier itself, which
can be used as a human-readable identifier for the signature (see
{{parameterised-binary}}). The present parameters MUST have the following
values:

"sig"

: Byte sequence (Section 3.10 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) holding
  the signature of most of these parameters and the exchange's URL and response
  headers.

"integrity"

: A string (Section 3.8 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) containing a
  "/"-separated sequence of names starting with the lowercase name of the
  response header field that guards the response payload's integrity. The
  meaning of subsequent names depends on the response header field, but for the
  "digest" header field, the single following name is the name of the digest
  algorithm that guards the payload's integrity.

"cert-url"

: A string (Section 3.8 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) containing an
  absolute URL ({{terminology}}) with a scheme of "https" or "data".

"cert-sha256"

: Byte sequence (Section 3.10 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) holding
  the SHA-256 hash of the first certificate found at "cert-url".

"ed25519key"

: Byte sequence (Section 3.10 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) holding
  an Ed25519 public key ({{!RFC8032}}).

{:#signature-validityurl} "validity-url"

: A string (Section 3.8 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) containing an
  absolute URL ({{terminology}}) with a scheme of "https".

"date" and "expires"

: An integer (Section 3.6 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}})
  representing a Unix time.

The "cert-url" parameter is *not* signed, so intermediates can update it with a
pointer to a cached version.

### Examples ### {#example-signature-header}

The following header is included in the response for an exchange with effective
request URI `https://example.com/resource.html`. Newlines are added for
readability.

~~~

There are 4 signatures: 2 from different secp256r1 certificates within
`https://example.com/`, one using a raw ed25519 public key that's also
controlled by `example.com`, and a fourth using a secp256r1 certificate owned by
`thirdparty.example.com`.

All 4 signatures rely on the `Digest` response header with the mi-sha256 digest
algorithm to guard the integrity of the response payload.

The signatures include a "validity-url" that includes the first time the resource
was seen. This allows multiple versions of a resource at the same URL to be
updated with new signatures, which allows clients to avoid transferring extra
data while the old versions don't have known security bugs.

The certificates at `https://example.com/oldcerts` and
`https://example.com/newcerts` have `subjectAltName`s of `example.com`, meaning
that if they and their signatures validate, the exchange can be trusted as
having an origin of `https://example.com/`. The publisher might be using two
certificates because their readers have disjoint sets of roots in their trust
stores.

The publisher signed with all three certificates at the same time, so they share
a validity range: 7 days starting at 2017-11-19 21:53 UTC.

The publisher then requested an additional signature from
`thirdparty.example.com`, which did some validation or processing and then
signed the resource at 2017-11-19 23:11 UTC. `thirdparty.example.com` only
grants 4-day signatures, so clients will need to re-validate more often.

### Open Questions ### {#oq-signature-header}

{{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} provides a way to parameterise
identifiers but not other supported types like byte sequences. If the
`Signature` header field is notionally a list of parameterised signatures, maybe
we should add a "parameterised byte sequence" type.
{:#parameterised-binary}

Should the cert-url and validity-url be lists so that intermediates can offer a
cache without losing the original URLs? Putting lists in dictionary fields is
more complex than {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} allows, so they're
single items for now.

## CBOR representation of exchange response headers ## {#cbor-representation}

To sign an exchange's response headers, they need to be serialized into a byte string.
Since intermediaries and [distributors](#uc-explicit-distributor) might
rearrange, add, or just reserialize headers, we can't use the literal bytes of
the headers as this serialization. Instead, this section defines a CBOR
representation that can be embedded into other CBOR, canonically serialized
({{canonical-cbor}}), and then signed.

The CBOR representation of a set of response metadata and headers is the CBOR
({{!RFC7049}}) map with the following mappings:

* The byte string ':status' to the byte string containing the response's 3-digit
  status code, and
* For each response header field, the header field's lowercase name as a byte
  string to the header field's value as a byte string.

### Example ### {#example-cbor-representation}

Given the HTTP exchange:

~~~http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/html
Digest: mi-sha256=dcRDgR2GM35DluAV13PzgnG6+pvQwPywfFvAu1UeFrs=
Signed-Headers: "content-type", "digest"

<!doctype html>
<html>
...
~~~

The cbor representation consists of the following item, represented using the
extended diagnostic notation from {{?I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}} appendix G:

~~~cbor-diag
{
  'digest': 'mi-sha256=dcRDgR2GM35DluAV13PzgnG6+pvQwPywfFvAu1UeFrs=',
  ':status': '200',
  'content-type': 'text/html'
}
~~~

## Loading a certificate chain ## {#cert-chain-format}

The resource at a signature's `cert-url` MUST have the
`application/cert-chain+cbor` content type, MUST be canonically-encoded CBOR
({{canonical-cbor}}), and MUST match the following CDDL:

~~~cddl
cert-chain = [
  "📜⛓", ; U+1F4DC U+26D3
  + {
    cert: bytes,
    ? ocsp: bytes,
    ? sct: bytes,
    * tstr => any,
  }
]
~~~

The first map (second item) in the CBOR array is treated as the end-entity
certificate, and the client will attempt to build a path ({{?RFC5280}}) to it
from a trusted root using the other certificates in the chain.

1. Each `cert` value MUST be a DER-encoded X.509v3 certificate ({{!RFC5280}}).
   Other key/value pairs in the same array item define properties of this
   certificate.
1. The first certificate's `ocsp` value MUST be a complete, DER-encoded OCSP
   response for that certificate (using the ASN.1 type `OCSPResponse` defined in
   {{!RFC6960}}). Subsequent certificates MUST NOT have an `ocsp` value.
1. Each certificate's `sct` value if any MUST be a
   `SignedCertificateTimestampList` for that certificate as defined by Section
   3.3 of {{!RFC6962}}.

Loading a `cert-url` takes a `forceFetch` flag. The client MUST:

1. Let `raw-chain` be the result of fetching ({{FETCH}}) `cert-url`. If
   `forceFetch` is *not* set, the fetch can be fulfilled from a cache using
   normal HTTP semantics {{!RFC7234}}. If this fetch fails, return
   "invalid".
1. Let `certificate-chain` be the array of certificates and properties produced
   by parsing `raw-chain` using the CDDL above. If any of the requirements above
   aren't satisfied, return "invalid". Note that this validation requirement
   might be impractical to completely achieve due to certificate validation
   implementations that don't enforce DER encoding or other standard
   constraints.
1. Return `certificate-chain`.

## Canonical CBOR serialization ## {#canonical-cbor}

Within this specification, the canonical serialization of a CBOR item uses the
following rules derived from Section 3.9 of {{?RFC7049}} with erratum 4964
applied:

* Integers and the lengths of arrays, maps, and strings MUST use the smallest
  possible encoding.
* Items MUST NOT be encoded with indefinite length.
* The keys in every map MUST be sorted in the bytewise lexicographic order of
  their canonical encodings. For example, the following keys are correctly sorted:
  1. 10, encoded as 0A.
  1. 100, encoded as 18 64.
  1. -1, encoded as 20.
  1. "z", encoded as 61 7A.
  1. "aa", encoded as 62 61 61.
  1. \[100], encoded as 81 18 64.
  1. \[-1], encoded as 81 20.
  1. false, encoded as F4.

Note: this specification does not use floating point, tags, or other more
complex data types, so it doesn't need rules to canonicalize those.

## Signature validity ## {#signature-validity}

The client MUST parse the `Signature` header field as the parameterised list
(Section 4.2.5 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) described in
{{signature-header}}. If an error is thrown during this parsing or any of the
requirements described there aren't satisfied, the exchange has no valid
signatures. Otherwise, each member of this list represents a signature with
parameters.

The client MUST use the following algorithm to determine whether each signature
with parameters is invalid or potentially-valid for an exchange's

* `requestUrl`, a byte sequence that can be parsed into the exchange's effective
  request URI (Section 5.5 of {{!RFC7230}}),
* `responseHeaders`, a byte sequence holding the canonical serialization
  ({{canonical-cbor}}) of the CBOR representation ({{cbor-representation}}) of
  the exchange's response metadata and headers, and
* `payload`, a stream of bytes constituting the exchange's payload body (Section
  3.3 of {{!RFC7230}}). Note that the payload body is the message body with any
  transfer encodings removed.

Potentially-valid results include:

* The signed headers of the exchange so that higher-level protocols can avoid
  relying on unsigned headers, and
* Either a certificate chain or a public key so that a higher-level protocol can
  determine whether it's actually valid.

This algorithm accepts a `forceFetch` flag that avoids the cache when fetching
URLs. A client that determines that a potentially-valid certificate chain is
actually invalid due to an expired OCSP response MAY retry with `forceFetch` set
to retrieve an updated OCSP from the original server.
{:#force-fetch}

1. Let:
   * `signature` be the signature (byte sequence in the parameterised
     identifier's "sig" parameter).
   * `integrity` be the signature's "integrity" parameter.
   * `validity-url` be the signature's "validity-url" parameter.
   * `cert-url` be the signature's "cert-url" parameter, if any.
   * `cert-sha256` be the signature's "cert-sha256" parameter, if any.
   * `ed25519key` be the signature's "ed25519key" parameter, if any.
   * `date` be the signature's "date" parameter, interpreted as a Unix time.
   * `expires` be the signature's "expires" parameter, interpreted as a Unix
     time.
1. Set `publicKey` and `signing-alg` depending on which key fields are present:
   1. If `cert-url` is present:
      1. Let `certificate-chain` be the result of loading the certificate chain
         at `cert-url` passing the `forceFetch` flag ({{cert-chain-format}}). If
         this returns "invalid", return "invalid".
      1. Let `main-certificate` be the first certificate in `certificate-chain`.
      1. Set `publicKey` to `main-certificate`'s public key.
      1. If `publicKey` is an RSA key, return "invalid".
      1. If `publicKey` is a key using the secp256r1 elliptic curve, set
         `signing-alg` to ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256 as defined in Section 4.2.3 of
         {{!RFC8446}}.
      1. Otherwise, either return "invalid" or set `signing-alg` to a non-legacy
         signing algorithm defined by TLS 1.3 or later
         ({{!RFC8446}}). This choice MUST depend only on
         `publicKey`'s type and not on any other context.
   1. If `ed25519key` is present, set `publicKey` to `ed25519key` and
      `signing-alg` to ed25519, as defined by {{!RFC8032}}
1. If `expires` is more than 7 days (604800 seconds) after `date`, return
   "invalid".
1. If the current time is before `date` or after `expires`, return "invalid".
1. Let `message` be the concatenation of the following byte strings. This
   matches the {{?RFC8446}} format to avoid cross-protocol attacks if
   anyone uses the same key in a TLS certificate and an exchange-signing
   certificate.
   1. A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times.
   1. A context string: the ASCII encoding of "HTTP Exchange 1".

      Note: RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS NOTE; The implementation of the final
      RFC MUST use this context string, but implementations of drafts MUST NOT
      use it and MUST use another draft-specific string beginning with "HTTP
      Exchange 1 ” instead. This ensures that signers can predict how their
      signatures will be used.
   1. A single 0 byte which serves as a separator.
   1. If `cert-sha256` is set, a byte holding the value 32 followed by the 32
      bytes of the value of `cert-sha256`. Otherwise a 0 byte.
   1. The 8-byte big-endian encoding of the length in bytes of `validity-url`,
      followed by the bytes of `validity-url`.
   1. The 8-byte big-endian encoding of `date`.
   1. The 8-byte big-endian encoding of `expires`.
   1. The 8-byte big-endian encoding of the length in bytes of `requestUrl`,
      followed by the bytes of `requestUrl`.
   1. The 8-byte big-endian encoding of the length in bytes of `responseHeaders`,
      followed by the bytes of `responseHeaders`.
1. If `cert-url` is present and the SHA-256 hash of `main-certificate`'s
   `cert_data` is not equal to `cert-sha256` (whose presence was checked when the
   `Signature` header field was parsed), return "invalid".

   Note that this intentionally differs from TLS 1.3, which signs the entire
   certificate chain in its Certificate Verify (Section 4.4.3 of
   {{?RFC8446}}), in order to allow updating the stapled OCSP
   response without updating signatures at the same time.
1. If `signature` is not a valid signature of `message` by `publicKey` using
   `signing-alg`, return "invalid".
1. If `headers`, interpreted according to {{cbor-representation}}, does not
   contain a `Content-Type` response header field (Section 3.1.1.5 of
   {{!RFC7231}}), return "invalid".

   Clients MUST interpret the signed payload as this specified media type
   instead of trying to sniff a media type from the bytes of the payload, for
   example by attaching an `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header field
   ({{FETCH}}) to the extracted response.
1. If `integrity` names a header field and parameter that is not present in
   `responseHeaders` or which the client cannot use to check the
   integrity of `payload` (for example, the header field is new and hasn't been
   implemented yet), then return "invalid". If the selected header field
   provides integrity guarantees weaker than SHA-256, return "invalid". If
   validating integrity using the selected header field requires the client to
   process records larger than 16384 bytes, return "invalid". Clients MUST
   implement at least the `Digest` header field with its `mi-sha256` digest
   algorithm (Section 3 of {{!I-D.thomson-http-mice}}).

   Note: RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS NOTE; Implementations of drafts of this
   RFC MUST recognize the draft spelling of the content encoding and digest
   algorithm specified by {{!I-D.thomson-http-mice}} until that draft is
   published as an RFC. For example, implementations of
   draft-thomson-http-mice-03 would use `mi-sha256-03` and MUST NOT use
   `mi-sha256` itself. This ensures that final implementations don't need to
   handle compatibility with implementations of early drafts of that content
   encoding.

   If `payload` doesn't match the integrity information in the header described
   by `integrity`, return "invalid".
1. Return "potentially-valid" with whichever is present of `certificate-chain`
   or `ed25519key`.


Note that the above algorithm can determine that an exchange's headers are
potentially-valid before the exchange's payload is received. Similarly, if
`integrity` identifies a header field and parameter like `Digest:mi-sha256`
({{?I-D.thomson-http-mice}})
that can incrementally validate the payload, early parts of the payload can be
determined to be potentially-valid before later parts of the payload.
Higher-level protocols MAY process parts of the exchange that have been
determined to be potentially-valid as soon as that determination is made but
MUST NOT process parts of the exchange that are not yet potentially-valid.
Similarly, as the higher-level protocol determines that parts of the exchange
are actually valid, the client MAY process those parts of the exchange and MUST
wait to process other parts of the exchange until they too are determined to be
valid.

Should the signed message use the TLS format (with an initial 64 spaces) even
though these certificates can't be used in TLS servers?

## Updating signature validity ## {#updating-validity}

Both OCSP responses and signatures are designed to expire a short
time after they're signed, so that revoked certificates and signed exchanges
with known vulnerabilities are distrusted promptly.

This specification provides no way to update OCSP responses by themselves.
Instead, [clients need to re-fetch the "cert-url"](#force-fetch) to get a chain
including a newer OCSP response.

The ["validity-url" parameter](#signature-validityurl) of the signatures provides
a way to fetch new signatures or learn where to fetch a complete updated
exchange.

Each version of a signed exchange SHOULD have its own validity URLs, since each
version needs different signatures and becomes obsolete at different times.

The resource at a "validity-url" is "validity data", a CBOR map matching the
following CDDL ({{!I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}):

~~~cddl
validity = {
  ? signatures: [ + bytes ]
  ? update: {
    ? size: uint,
  }
]
~~~

The elements of the `signatures` array are parameterised identifiers (Section
4.2.6 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) meant to replace the signatures
within the `Signature` header field pointing to this validity data. If the
signed exchange contains a bug severe enough that clients need to stop using the
content, the `signatures` array MUST NOT be present.

If the the `update` map is present, that indicates that a new version of the
signed exchange is available at its effective request URI (Section 5.5 of
{{!RFC7230}}) and can give an estimate of the size of the updated exchange
(`update.size`). If the signed exchange is currently the most recent version,
the `update` SHOULD NOT be present.

If both the `signatures` and `update` fields are present, clients can use the
estimated size to decide whether to update the whole resource or just its
signatures.

### Examples ### {#examples-updating-validity}

For example, say a signed exchange whose URL is `https://example.com/resource`
has the following `Signature` header field (with line breaks included and
irrelevant fields omitted for ease of reading).

~~~http
Signature:
 sig1;
  sig=*MEUCIQ...*;
  ...
  validity-url="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180";
  cert-url="https://example.com/oldcerts";
  date=1511128380; expires=1511733180,
 sig2;
  sig=*MEQCIG...*;
  ...
  validity-url="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180";
  cert-url="https://example.com/newcerts";
  date=1511128380; expires=1511733180,
 thirdpartysig;
  sig=*MEYCIQ...*;
  ...
  validity-url="https://thirdparty.example.com/resource.validity.1511161860";
  cert-url="https://thirdparty.example.com/certs";
  date=1511478660; expires=1511824260
~~~

At 2017-11-27 11:02 UTC, `sig1` and `sig2` have expired, but `thirdpartysig`
doesn't exipire until 23:11 that night, so the client needs to fetch
`https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180` (the `validity-url` of `sig1`
and `sig2`) if it wishes to update those signatures. This URL might contain:

~~~cbor-diag
{
  "signatures": [
    'sig1; '
    'sig=*MEQCIC/I9Q+7BZFP6cSDsWx43pBAL0ujTbON/+7RwKVk+ba5AiB3FSFLZqpzmDJ0NumNwN04pqgJZE99fcK86UjkPbj4jw==*; '
    'validity-url="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180"; '
    'integrity="digest/mi-sha256"; '
    'cert-url="https://example.com/newcerts"; '
    'cert-sha256=*J/lEm9kNRODdCmINbvitpvdYKNQ+YgBj99DlYp4fEXw=*; '
    'date=1511733180; expires=1512337980'
  ],
  "update": {
    "size": 5557452
  }
}
~~~

This indicates that the client could fetch a newer version at
`https://example.com/resource` (the original URL of the exchange), or that the
validity period of the old version can be extended by replacing the first two of
the original signatures (the ones with a validity-url of
`https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180`) with the single new
signature provided. (This might happen at the end of a migration to a new root
certificate.) The signatures of the updated signed exchange would be:

~~~http
Signature:
 sig1;
  sig=*MEQCIC...*;
  ...
  validity-url="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180";
  cert-url="https://example.com/newcerts";
  date=1511733180; expires=1512337980,
 thirdpartysig;
  sig=*MEYCIQ...*;
  ...
  validity-url="https://thirdparty.example.com/resource.validity.1511161860";
  cert-url="https://thirdparty.example.com/certs";
  date=1511478660; expires=1511824260
~~~

`https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180` could also expand the set of
signatures if its `signatures` array contained more than 2 elements.

## The Accept-Signature header ## {#accept-signature}

`Signature` header fields cost on the order of 300 bytes for ECDSA signatures,
so servers might prefer to avoid sending them to clients that don't intend to
use them. A client can send the `Accept-Signature` header field to indicate that
it does intend to take advantage of any available signatures and to indicate
what kinds of signatures it supports.

When a server receives an `Accept-Signature` header field in a client request,
it SHOULD reply with any available `Signature` header fields for its response
that the `Accept-Signature` header field indicates the client supports. However,
if the `Accept-Signature` value violates a requirement in this section, the
server MUST behave as if it hadn't received any `Accept-Signature` header at
all.

The `Accept-Signature` header field is a Structured Header as defined by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be a parameterised list
(Section 3.4 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}). Its ABNF is:

    Accept-Signature = sh-param-list

The order of identifiers in the `Accept-Signature` list is not significant.
Identifiers, ignoring any initial "-" character, MUST NOT be duplicated.

Each identifier in the `Accept-Signature` header field's value indicates that a
feature of the `Signature` header field ({{signature-header}}) is supported. If
the identifier begins with a "-" character, it instead indicates that the
feature named by the rest of the identifier is not supported. Unknown
identifiers and parameters MUST be ignored because new identifiers and new
parameters on existing identifiers may be defined by future specifications.

### Integrity identifiers ### {#accept-signature-integrity}

Identifiers starting with "digest/" indicate that the client supports the
`Digest` header field ({{!RFC3230) with the parameter from the [HTTP Digest
Algorithm Values
Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-dig-alg/http-dig-alg.xhtml)
registry named in lower-case by the rest of the identifier. For example,
"digest/mi-blake2" indicates support for Merkle integrity with the
as-yet-unspecified mi-blake2 parameter, and "-digest/mi-sha256" indicates
non-support for Merkle integrity with the mi-sha256 content encoding.

If the `Accept-Signature` header field is present, servers SHOULD assume support
for "digest/mi-sha256" unless the header field states otherwise.

### Key type identifiers ### {#accept-signature-key-types}

Identifiers starting with "ecdsa/" indicate that the client supports
certificates holding ECDSA public keys on the curve named in lower-case by the
rest of the identifier.

If the `Accept-Signature` header field is present, servers SHOULD assume support
for "ecdsa/secp256r1" unless the header field states otherwise.

### Key value identifiers ### {#accept-signature-key-values}

The "ed25519key" identifier has parameters indicating the public keys that will
be used to validate the returned signature. Each parameter's name is
re-interpreted as a byte sequence (Section 3.10 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) encoding a prefix of the public key. For
example, if the client will validate signatures using the public key whose
base64 encoding is `11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo=`, valid
`Accept-Signature` header fields include:

~~~http
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo=*
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg==*
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYAQ==*
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; **
~~~

but not

~~~http
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYA===*
~~~

because 5 bytes isn't a valid length for encoded base64, and not

~~~http
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; 11qYAQ
~~~

because it doesn't start or end with the `*`s that indicate a byte sequence.

Note that `ed25519key; **` is an empty prefix, which matches all public keys, so
it's useful in subresource integrity ({{uc-sri}}) cases like `<link rel=preload
as=script href="...">` where the public key isn't known until the matching
`<script src="..." integrity="...">` tag.

### Examples ### {#accept-signature-examples}

~~~http
Accept-Signature: digest/mi-sha256
~~~

states that the client will accept signatures with payload integrity assured by
the `Digest` header and `mi-sha256` digest algorithm and implies that the client
will accept signatures from ECDSA keys on the secp256r1 curve.

~~~http
Accept-Signature: -ecdsa/secp256r1, ecdsa/secp384r1
~~~

states that the client will accept ECDSA keys on the secp384r1 curve but not the
secp256r1 curve and payload integrity assured with the `Digest: mi-sha256`
header field.

### Open Questions ### {#oq-accept-signature}

Is an `Accept-Signature` header useful enough to pay for itself? If clients wind
up sending it on most requests, that may cost more than the cost of sending
`Signature`s unconditionally. On the other hand, it gives servers an indication
of which kinds of signatures are supported, which can help us upgrade the
ecosystem in the future.

Is `Accept-Signature` the right spelling, or do we want to imitate `Want-Digest`
(Section 4.3.1 of {{?RFC3230}}) instead?

Do I have the right structure for the identifiers indicating feature support?

# Cross-origin trust {#cross-origin-trust}

To determine whether to trust a cross-origin exchange, the client takes a
`Signature` header field ({{signature-header}}) and the exchange's

* `requestUrl`, a byte sequence that can be parsed into the exchange's effective
  request URI (Section 5.5 of {{!RFC7230}}),
* `responseHeaders`, a byte sequence holding the canonical serialization
  ({{canonical-cbor}}) of the CBOR representation ({{cbor-representation}}) of
  the exchange's response metadata and headers, and
* `payload`, a stream of bytes constituting the exchange's payload body (Section
  3.3 of {{!RFC7230}}).

The client MUST parse the `Signature` header into a list of signatures according
to the instructions in {{signature-validity}}, and run the following algorithm
for each signature, stopping at the first one that returns "valid". If any
signature returns "valid", return "valid". Otherwise, return "invalid".

1. If the signature's ["validity-url" parameter](#signature-validityurl) is not
   [same-origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#same-origin)
   with `requestUrl`, return "invalid".
1. Use {{signature-validity}} to determine the signature's validity for
   `requestUrl`, `responseHeaders`, and `payload`, getting `certificate-chain` back. If
   this returned "invalid" or didn't return a certificate chain, return
   "invalid".
1. Let `response` be the response metadata and headers parsed out of
   `responseHeaders`.
1. If Section 3 of {{!RFC7234}} forbids a shared cache from storing `response`,
   return "invalid".
1. If `response`'s headers contain an uncached header field, as defined in
   {{uncached-headers}}, return "invalid".
1. Let `authority` be the host component of `requestUrl`.
1. Validate the `certificate-chain` using the following substeps. If any of them
   fail, re-run {{signature-validity}} once over the signature with the
   `forceFetch` flag set, and restart from step 2. If a substep fails again,
   return "invalid".
   1. Use `certificate-chain` to validate that its first entry,
      `main-certificate` is trusted as `authority`'s server certificate
      ({{!RFC5280}} and other undocumented conventions). Let `path` be the path
      that was used from the `main-certificate` to a trusted root, including the
      `main-certificate` but excluding the root.
   1. Validate that `main-certificate` has the CanSignHttpExchanges extension
      ({{cross-origin-cert-req}}).
   1. Validate that `main-certificate` has an `ocsp` property
      ({{cert-chain-format}}) with a valid OCSP response whose lifetime
      (`nextUpdate - thisUpdate`) is less than 7 days ({{!RFC6960}}). Note that
      this does not check for revocation of intermediate certificates, and
      clients SHOULD implement another mechanism for that.
   1. Validate that valid SCTs from trusted logs are available from any of:

      * The `SignedCertificateTimestampList` in `main-certificate`'s `sct`
        property ({{cert-chain-format}}),
      * An OCSP extension in the OCSP response in `main-certificate`'s `ocsp`
        property, or
      * An X.509 extension in the certificate in `main-certificate`'s `cert`
        property,

      as described by Section 3.3 of {{!RFC6962}}.
1. Return "valid".

## Uncached header fields {#uncached-headers}

Hop-by-hop and other uncached headers MUST NOT appear in a signed exchange.
These will eventually be listed in {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-cache}}, but for now
they're listed here:

* Hop-by-hop header fields listed in the Connection header field (Section 6.1 of
  {{!RFC7230}}).
* Header fields listed in the no-cache response directive in the Cache-Control
  header field (Section 5.2.2.2 of {{!RFC7234}}).
* Header fields defined as hop-by-hop:
   * Connection
   * Keep-Alive
   * Proxy-Connection
   * Trailer
   * Transfer-Encoding
   * Upgrade
* Stateful headers as defined below.

### Stateful header fields {#stateful-headers}

As described in {{seccons-over-signing}}, a publisher can cause problems if they
sign an exchange that includes private information. There's no way for a client
to be sure an exchange does or does not include private information, but header
fields that store or convey stored state in the client are a good sign.

A stateful response header field modifies state, including authentication
status, in the client. The HTTP cache is not considered part of this state.
These include but are not limited to:

* `Authentication-Control`, {{?RFC8053}}
* `Authentication-Info`, {{?RFC7615}}
* `Clear-Site-Data`, {{?W3C.WD-clear-site-data-20171130}}
* `Optional-WWW-Authenticate`, {{?RFC8053}}
* `Proxy-Authenticate`, {{?RFC7235}}
* `Proxy-Authentication-Info`, {{?RFC7615}}
* `Public-Key-Pins`, {{?RFC7469}}
* `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, {{?RFC6455}}
* `Set-Cookie`, {{?RFC6265}}
* `Set-Cookie2`, {{?RFC2965}}
* `SetProfile`, {{?W3C.NOTE-OPS-OverHTTP}}
* `Strict-Transport-Security`, {{?RFC6797}}
* `WWW-Authenticate`, {{?RFC7235}}

## Certificate Requirements {#cross-origin-cert-req}

We define a new X.509 extension, CanSignHttpExchanges to be used in the
certificate when the certificate permits the usage of signed exchanges.  When
this extension is not present the client MUST NOT accept a signature from the
certificate as proof that a signed exchange is authoritative for a domain
covered by the certificate. When it is present, the client MUST follow the
validation procedure in {{cross-origin-trust}}.

~~~asn.1
   id-ce-canSignHttpExchanges OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { TBD }

   CanSignHttpExchanges ::= NULL
~~~

Note that this extension contains an ASN.1 NULL (bytes `05 00`) because some
implementations have bugs with empty extensions.

Leaf certificates without this extension need to be revoked if the private key
is exposed to an unauthorized entity, but they generally don't need to be
revoked if a signing oracle is exposed and then removed.

CA certificates, by contrast, need to be revoked if an unauthorized entity is
able to make even one unauthorized signature.

Certificates with this extension MUST be revoked if an unauthorized entity is
able to make even one unauthorized signature.

Certificates with this extension MUST have a Validity Period no greater than 90
days.

Conforming CAs MUST NOT mark this extension as critical.

A conforming CA MUST NOT issue certificates with this extension unless, for each
dNSName in the subjectAltName extension of the certificate to be issued:

1. An "issue" or "issuewild" CAA property ({{!RFC6844}}) exists that authorizes
   the CA to issue the certificate; and
1. The "cansignhttpexchanges" parameter ({{caa-cansignhttpexchanges}}) is
   present on the property and is equal to "yes"

Clients MUST NOT accept certificates with this extension in TLS connections
(Section 4.4.2.2 of {{!RFC8446}}).

RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THE REST OF THE PARAGRAPHS IN THIS SECTION

~~~asn.1
   id-ce-google OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 6 1 4 1 11129 }
   id-ce-canSignHttpExchangesDraft OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce-google 2 1 22 }
~~~

Implementations of drafts of this specification MAY recognize the
`id-ce-canSignHttpExchangesDraft` OID as identifying the CanSignHttpExchanges
extension. This OID might or might not be used as the final OID for the
extension, so certificates including it might need to be reissued once the final
RFC is published.

Some certificates have already been issued with this extension and with validity
periods longer than 90 days. These certificates will not immediately be treated
as invalid. Instead:

* Clients MUST reject certificates with this extension that were issued after
  2019-05-01 and have a Validity Period longer than 90 days.
* After 2019-08-01, clients MUST reject all certificates with this extension
  that have a Validity Period longer than 90 days.

The above requirements on CAs to limit the Validity Period and check for a CAA
parameter are effective starting 2019-05-01.

### Extensions to the CAA Record: cansignhttpexchanges Parameter {#caa-cansignhttpexchanges}

A CAA parameter "cansignhttpexchanges" is defined for the "issue" and
"issuewild" properties defined by {{!RFC6844}}.  The value of this parameter, if
specified, MUST be "yes".

# Transferring a signed exchange {#transfer}

A signed exchange can be transferred in several ways, of which three are
described here.

## Same-origin response {#same-origin-response}

The signature for a signed exchange can be included in a normal HTTP response.
Because different clients send different request header fields, clients don't
know how the server's content negotiation algorithm works, and intermediate
servers add response header fields, it can be impossible to have a signature for
the exchange's exact request, content negotiation, and response. Therefore, when a client
calls the validation procedure in {{signature-validity}}) to validate the
`Signature` header field for an exchange represented as a normal HTTP
request/response pair, it MUST pass:

* The `Signature` header field,
* The effective request URI (Section 5.5 of {{!RFC7230}}) of the request,
* The serialized headers defined by {{serialized-headers}}, and
* The response's payload.

If the client relies on signature validity for any aspect of its behavior, it
MUST ignore any header fields that it didn't pass to the validation procedure.

If the signed response includes a `Variants` header field, the client MUST use
the cache behavior algorithm in Section 4 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}} to
check that the signed response is an appropriate representation for the request
the client is trying to fulfil. If the response is not an appropriate
representation, the client MUST treat the signature as invalid.

### Serialized headers for a same-origin response {#serialized-headers}

The serialized headers of an exchange represented as a normal HTTP
request/response pair (Section 2.1 of {{?RFC7230}} or Section 8.1 of
{{?RFC7540}}) are the canonical serialization ({{canonical-cbor}}) of the CBOR
representation ({{cbor-representation}}) of the response status code (Section 6
of {{!RFC7231}}) and the response header fields whose names are listed in that
response's `Signed-Headers` header field ({{signed-headers}}). If a response
header field name from `Signed-Headers` does not appear in the response's header
fields, the exchange has no serialized headers.

If the exchange's `Signed-Headers` header field is not present, doesn't parse as
a Structured Header ({{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) or doesn't follow
the constraints on its value described in {{signed-headers}}, the exchange has
no serialized headers.

#### Open Questions {#oq-serialized-headers}

Do the serialized headers of an exchange need to include the `Signed-Headers`
header field itself?

### The Signed-Headers Header {#signed-headers}

The `Signed-Headers` header field identifies an ordered list of response header
fields to include in a signature. The request URL and response status are
included unconditionally. This allows a TLS-terminating intermediate to reorder
headers without breaking the signature. This *can* also allow the intermediate
to add headers that will be ignored by some higher-level protocols, but
{{signature-validity}} provides a hook to let other higher-level protocols
reject such insecure headers.

This header field appears once instead of being incorporated into the
signatures' parameters because the signed header fields need to be consistent
across all signatures of an exchange, to avoid forcing higher-level protocols to
merge the header field lists of valid signatures.

`Signed-Headers` is a Structured Header as defined by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be a list (Section 3.2 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}). Its ABNF is:

    Signed-Headers = sh-list

Each element of the `Signed-Headers` list must be a lowercase string (Section
3.8 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) naming an HTTP response header
field. Pseudo-header field names (Section 8.1.2.1 of {{!RFC7540}}) MUST NOT
appear in this list.

Higher-level protocols SHOULD place requirements on the minimum set of headers
to include in the `Signed-Headers` header field.



## HTTP/2 extension for cross-origin Server Push # {#cross-origin-push}

To allow servers to Server-Push (Section 8.2 of {{?RFC7540}}) signed exchanges
({{proposal}}) signed by an authority for which the server is not authoritative
(Section 9.1 of {{?RFC7230}}), this section defines an HTTP/2 extension.

### Indicating support for cross-origin Server Push # {#setting}

Clients that might accept signed Server Pushes with an authority for which the
server is not authoritative indicate this using the HTTP/2 SETTINGS parameter
ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH (0xSETTING-TBD).

An ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH value of 0 indicates that the client does not
support cross-origin Push. A value of 1 indicates that the client does support
cross-origin Push.

A client MUST NOT send a ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH setting with a value other
than 0 or 1 or a value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1. If a server
receives a value that violates these rules, it MUST treat it as a connection
error (Section 5.4.1 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

The use of a SETTINGS parameter to opt-in to an otherwise incompatible protocol
change is a use of "Extending HTTP/2" defined by Section 5.5 of {{?RFC7540}}. If
a server were to send a cross-origin Push without first receiving a
ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH setting with the value of 1 it would be a protocol
violation.

### NO_TRUSTED_EXCHANGE_SIGNATURE error code {#error-code}

The signatures on a Pushed cross-origin exchange may be untrusted for several
reasons, for example that the certificate could not be fetched, that the
certificate does not chain to a trusted root, that the signature itself doesn't
validate, that the signature is expired, etc. This draft conflates all of these
possible failures into one error code, NO_TRUSTED_EXCHANGE_SIGNATURE
(0xERROR-TBD).

#### Open Questions ### {#oq-error-code}

How fine-grained should this specification's error codes be?

### Validating a cross-origin Push ## {#validating-cross-origin-push}

If the client has set the ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH setting to 1, the server MAY
Push a signed exchange for which it is not authoritative, and the client MUST
NOT treat a PUSH_PROMISE for which the server is not authoritative as a stream
error (Section 5.4.2 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR, as described in
Section 8.2 of {{?RFC7540}}, unless there is another error as described below.

Instead, the client MUST validate such a PUSH_PROMISE and its response against
the following list:

1. If the PUSH_PROMISE includes any non-pseudo request header fields, the client
   MUST treat it as a stream error (Section 5.4.2 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type
   PROTOCOL_ERROR.
1. If the PUSH_PROMISE's method is not `GET`, the client MUST treat it as a
   stream error (Section 5.4.2 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.
1. Run the algorithm in {{cross-origin-trust}} over:
   * The `Signature` header field from the response.
   * The effective request URI from the PUSH_PROMISE.
   * The canonical serialization ({{canonical-cbor}}) of the CBOR representation
     ({{cbor-representation}}) of the pushed response's status and its headers
     except for the `Signature` header field.
   * The response's payload.

   If this returns "invalid", the client MUST treat the response as a stream error
   (Section 5.4.2 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type NO_TRUSTED_EXCHANGE_SIGNATURE.
   Otherwise, the client MUST treat the pushed response as if the server were
   authoritative for the PUSH_PROMISE's authority.

#### Open Questions ### {#oq-cross-origin-push}

Is it right that "validity-url" is required to be same-origin with the exchange?
This allows the mitigation against downgrades in {{seccons-downgrades}}, but
prohibits intermediates from providing a cache of the validity information. We
could do both with a list of URLs.

## application/signed-exchange format # {#application-signed-exchange}

To allow signed exchanges to be the targets of `<link rel=prefetch>` tags, we
define the  `application/signed-exchange` content type that represents a signed
HTTP exchange, including a request URL, response metadata
and header fields, and a response payload.

When served over HTTP, a response containing an `application/signed-exchange`
payload MUST include at least the following response header fields, to reduce
content sniffing vulnerabilities ({{seccons-content-sniffing}}):

* Content-Type: application/signed-exchange;v=*version*
* X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

This content type consists of the concatenation of the following items:

1. 8 bytes consisting of the ASCII characters "sxg1" followed by 4 0x00 bytes,
   to serve as a file signature. This is redundant with the MIME type, and
   recipients that receive both MUST check that they match and stop parsing if
   they don't.

   Note: RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS NOTE; The implementation of the final RFC
   MUST use this file signature, but implementations of drafts MUST NOT use it
   and MUST use another implementation-specific 8-byte string beginning with
   "sxg1-".
1. 2 bytes storing a big-endian integer `fallbackUrlLength`.
1. `fallbackUrlLength` bytes holding a `fallbackUrl`, which MUST be an absolute
   URL with a scheme of "https".

   Note: The byte location of the fallback URL is intended to remain invariant
   across versions of the `application/signed-exchange` format so that parsers
   encountering unknown versions can always find a URL to redirect to.

   Issue: Should this fallback information also include the method?
1. 3 bytes storing a big-endian integer `sigLength`. If this is larger than
   16384 (16*1024), parsing MUST fail.
1. 3 bytes storing a big-endian integer `headerLength`. If this is larger than
   524288 (512*1024), parsing MUST fail.
1. `sigLength` bytes holding the `Signature` header field's value
   ({{signature-header}}).
1. `headerLength` bytes holding `signedHeaders`, the canonical serialization
   ({{canonical-cbor}}) of the CBOR representation of the response
   headers of the exchange represented by the `application/signed-exchange`
   resource ({{cbor-representation}}), excluding the `Signature` header field.
1. The payload body (Section 3.3 of {{!RFC7230}}) of the exchange represented by
   the `application/signed-exchange` resource.

   Note that the use of the payload body here means that a `Transfer-Encoding`
   header field inside the `application/signed-exchange` header block has no
   effect. A `Transfer-Encoding` header field on the outer HTTP response that
   transfers this resource still has its normal effect.

### Cross-origin trust in application/signed-exchange {#co-trust-app-signed-exchange}

To determine whether to trust a cross-origin exchange stored in an
`application/signed-exchange` resource, pass the `Signature` header field's
value, `fallbackUrl` as the effective request URI, `signedHeaders`, and the
payload body to the algorithm in {{cross-origin-trust}}.

### Example ## {#example-application-signed-exchange}

An example `application/signed-exchange` file representing a possible signed
exchange with <https://example.com/> follows, with lengths represented by
descriptions in `<>`s, CBOR represented in the extended diagnostic format
defined in Appendix G of {{?I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}, and most of the `Signature`
header field and payload elided with a ...:

~~~
sxg1\0\0\0\0<2-byte length of the following url string>
https://example.com/<3-byte length of the following header
value><3-byte length of the encoding of the
following map>sig1; sig=*...; integrity="digest/mi-sha256"; ...{
  ':status': '200',
  'content-type': 'text/html'
}<!doctype html>\r\n<html>...
~~~

### Open Questions ## {#oq-application-signed-exchange}

Should this be a CBOR format, or is the current mix of binary and CBOR better?

Are the mime type, extension, and magic number right?

# Security considerations

## Over-signing ## {#seccons-over-signing}

If a publisher blindly signs all responses as their origin, they can cause at
least two kinds of problems, described below. To avoid this, publishers SHOULD
design their systems to opt particular public content that doesn't depend on
authentication status into signatures instead of signing by default.

Signing systems SHOULD also incorporate the following mitigations to reduce the
risk that private responses are signed:

1. Strip the `Cookie` request header field and other identifying information
   like client authentication and TLS session IDs from requests whose exchange
   is destined to be signed, before forwarding the request to a backend.
1. Only sign exchanges where the response includes a `Cache-Control: public`
   header. Clients are not required to fail signature-checking for exchanges
   that omit this `Cache-Control` response header field to reduce the risk that
   naïve signing systems blindly add it.

### Session fixation ### {#seccons-session-fixation}

Blind signing can sign responses that create session cookies or otherwise change
state on the client to identify a particular session. This breaks certain kinds
of CSRF defense and can allow an attacker to force a user into the attacker's
account, where the user might unintentionally save private information, like
credit card numbers or addresses.

This specification defends against cookie-based attacks by blocking the
`Set-Cookie` response header, but it cannot prevent Javascript or other response
content from changing state.

### Misleading content ### {#seccons-misleading-content}

If a site signs private information, an attacker might set up their own account
to show particular private information, forward that signed information to a
victim, and use that victim's confusion in a more sophisticated attack.

Stripping authentication information from requests before sending them to
backends is likely to prevent the backend from showing attacker-specific
information in the signed response. It does not prevent the attacker from
showing their victim a signed-out page when the victim is actually signed in,
but while this is still misleading, it seems less likely to be useful to the
attacker.

## Off-path attackers ## {#seccons-off-path}

Relaxing the requirement to consult DNS when determining authority for an origin
means that an attacker who possesses a valid certificate no longer needs to be
on-path to redirect traffic to them; instead of modifying DNS or IP routing,
they need only convince the user to visit another Web site in order to serve
responses signed as the target. This consideration and mitigations for it are
shared by the combination of {{?RFC8336}} and
{{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2-secondary-certs}}, and are discussed further in
{{?I-D.bishop-httpbis-origin-fed-up}}.

### Mis-issued certificates

If a CA mis-issues a certificate for a domain, this specification provides a way
to detect the mis-issuance and mitigate harm within approximately two weeks.
Specifically, because all signed exchanges must include a
`SignedCertificateTimestampList` ({{?RFC6962}}, a CT log has promised to publish
the mis-issued certificate within that log's Maximum Merge Delay, 1 day for many
logs. The domain owner can then detect the mis-issued certificate and notify the
CA to revoke it, which the {{BRs}}, section 4.9.1.1, say they must do within
another 5 days.

Once the mis-issued certificate is revoked, existing OCSP responses begin to
expire. The {{BRs}}, section 4.9.10, require that OCSP responses have a maximum
expiration time of 10 days, after which they can't be used to validate a
certificate chain ({{cert-chain-format}}). This leads to a total compromised
time of 16 days after a mis-issuance.

However, CAs might future-date their OCSP responses, in which case the
mitigation doesn't work.

CAs are forbidden from future-dating their OCSP responses by the {{BRs}} section
4.9.9, "OCSP responses MUST conform to RFC6960 and/or RFC5019." {{?RFC6960}}
includes, "The time at which the status was known to be correct SHALL be
reflected in the thisUpdate field of the response.", and {{?RFC5019}} includes,
"When pre-producing OCSPResponse messages, the responder MUST set the
thisUpdate, nextUpdate, and producedAt times as follows: thisUpdate: The time at
which the status being indicated is known to be correct."

However, if a CA violates the {{BRs}} to sign future-dated OCSP responses,
attempts to keep the nonconformant OCSP responses private, but then leaks them,
it could cause clients to trust a hostile signed exchange long after its
certificate has been revoked.

Clients could use systems like {{CRLSets}} and {{OneCrl}} to revoke the
intermediate certificate that signed the future-dated OCSP responses.

### Stolen private keys

If the private key for a CanSignHttpExchanges certificate is stolen, it can be
used at scale until the certificate expires or is revoked, and unlike for a
stolen key for a normal TLS-terminating certificate, the rightful owner can't
detect the problem by watching for attacks on the DNS or routing infrastructure.

This specification does not currently propose a way for the rightful owner to
detect that their keys are being used by an attacker, after they've opted into
the risk by requesting a CanSignHttpExchanges certificate in the first place.
Clients can fetch a signature's "validity-url" ({{signature-header}}) to help
owners detect key compromise, but that compromises some of the privacy
properties of this specification.

## Downgrades ## {#seccons-downgrades}

Signing a bad response can affect more users than simply serving a bad response,
since a served response will only affect users who make a request while the bad
version is live, while an attacker can forward a signed response until its
signature expires. Publishers should consider shorter signature expiration times
than they use for cache expiration times.

Clients MAY also check the ["validity-url"](#signature-validityurl) of an
exchange more often than the signature's expiration would require. Doing so for
an exchange with an HTTPS request URI provides a TLS guarantee that the exchange
isn't out of date (as long as {{oq-cross-origin-push}} is resolved to keep the
same-origin requirement).

## Signing oracles are permanent ## {#seccons-signing-oracles}

An attacker with temporary access to a signing oracle can sign "still valid"
assertions with arbitrary timestamps and expiration times. As a result, when a
signing oracle is removed, the keys it provided access to MUST be revoked so
that, even if the attacker used them to sign future-dated exchange validity
assertions, the key's OCSP assertion will expire, causing the exchange as a
whole to become untrusted.

## Unsigned headers ## {#seccons-unsigned-headers}

The use of a single `Signed-Headers` header field prevents us from signing
aspects of the request other than its effective request URI (Section 5.5 of
{{?RFC7230}}). For example, if a publisher signs both `Content-Encoding: br` and
`Content-Encoding: gzip` variants of a response, what's the impact if an
attacker serves the brotli one for a request with `Accept-Encoding: gzip`? This
is mitigated by using {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}} instead of request headers
to describe how the client should run content negotiation.

The simple form of `Signed-Headers` also prevents us from signing less than the
full request URL. The SRI use case ({{uc-sri}}) may benefit from being able to
leave the authority less constrained.

{{signature-validity}} can succeed when some delivered headers aren't included
in the signed set. This accommodates current TLS-terminating intermediates and
may be useful for SRI ({{uc-sri}}), but is risky for trusting cross-origin
responses ({{uc-pushed-subresources}}, {{uc-explicit-distributor}}, and
{{uc-offline-websites}}). {{cross-origin-push}} requires all headers to be
included in the signature before trusting cross-origin pushed resources, at Ryan
Sleevi's recommendation.

## application/signed-exchange ## {#security-application-signed-exchange}

Clients MUST NOT trust an effective request URI claimed by an
`application/signed-exchange` resource ({{application-signed-exchange}}) without
either ensuring the resource was transferred from a server that was
authoritative (Section 9.1 of {{!RFC7230}}) for that URI's origin, or calling
the algorithm in {{co-trust-app-signed-exchange}} and getting "valid" back.

## Key re-use with TLS ## {#seccons-key-re-use}

In general, key re-use across multiple protocols is a bad idea.

Using an exchange-signing key in a TLS (or other directly-internet-facing)
server increases the risk that an attacker can steal the private key, which will
allow them to mint packages (similar to {{seccons-signing-oracles}}) until their
theft is discovered.

Using a TLS key in a CanSignHttpExchanges certificate makes it less likely that
the server operator will discover key theft, due to the considerations in
{{seccons-off-path}}.

This specification uses the CanSignHttpExchanges X.509 extension
({{cross-origin-cert-req}}) to discourage re-use of TLS keys to sign exchanges
or vice-versa.

We require that clients reject certificates with the CanSignHttpExchanges
extension when making TLS connections to minimize the chance that servers will
re-use keys like this. Ideally, we would make the extension critical so that
even clients that don't understand it would reject such TLS connections, but
this proved impossible because certificate-validating libraries ship on
significantly different schedules from the clients that use them.

Even once all clients reject these certificates in TLS connections, this will
still just discourage and not prevent key re-use, since a server operator can
unwisely request two different certificates with the same private key.

## Content sniffing ## {#seccons-content-sniffing}

While modern browsers tend to trust the `Content-Type` header sent with a
resource, especially when accompanied by `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
plugins will sometimes search for executable content buried inside a resource
and execute it in the context of the origin that served the resource, leading to
XSS vulnerabilities. For example, some PDF reader plugins look for `%PDF`
anywhere in the first 1kB and execute the code that follows it.

The `application/signed-exchange` format ({{application-signed-exchange}})
includes a URL and response headers early in the format, which an
attacker could use to cause these plugins to sniff a bad content type.

To avoid vulnerabilities, in addition to the response header requirements in
{{application-signed-exchange}}, servers are advised to only serve an
`application/signed-exchange` resource (SXG) from a domain if it would also be
safe for that domain to serve the SXG's content directly, and to follow at least
one of the following strategies:

1. Only serve signed exchanges from dedicated domains that don't have access to
   sensitive cookies or user storage.
1. Generate signed exchanges "offline", that is, in response to a trusted author
   submitting content or existing signatures reaching a certain age, rather than
   in response to untrusted-reader queries.
1. Do all of:
   1. If the SXG's fallback URL ({{application-signed-exchange}}) is derived
      from the request URL,
      [percent-encode](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode) ({{URL}})
      any bytes that are greater than 0x7E or are not [URL code
      points](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points) ({{URL}}) in the
      fallback URL . It is particularly important to make sure no unescaped
      nulls (0x00) or angle brackets (0x3C and 0x3E) appear.
   1. Do not reflect request header fields into the set of response headers.

There are still a few binary length fields that an attacker may influence to
contain sensitive bytes, but they're always followed by lowercase alphabetic
strings from a small set of possibilities, which reduces the chance that a
client will sniff them as indicating a particular content type.

To encourage servers to include the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
field, clients SHOULD reject signed exchanges served without it.

# Privacy considerations

## Confidentiality {#priv-confidentiality}

Normally, when a client fetches `https://o1.com/resource.js`,
`o1.com` learns that the client is interested in the resource. If
`o1.com` signs `resource.js`, `o2.com` serves it as
`https://o2.com/o1resource.js`, and the client fetches it from there,
then `o2.com` learns that the client is interested, and if the client
executes the Javascript, that could also report the client's interest back to
`o1.com`.

Often, `o2.com` already knew about the client's interest, because it's the
entity that directed the client to `o1resource.js`, but there may be cases where
this leaks extra information.

For non-executable resource types, a signed response can improve the privacy
situation by hiding the client's interest from the original publisher.

To prevent network operators other than `o1.com` or `o2.com` from learning which
exchanges were read, clients SHOULD only load exchanges fetched over a transport
that's protected from eavesdroppers. This can be difficult to determine when the
exchange is being loaded from local disk, but when the client itself requested
the exchange over a network it SHOULD require TLS ({{!RFC8446}}) or a
successor transport layer, and MUST NOT accept exchanges transferred over plain
HTTP without TLS.

## Watermarking {#priv-watermarking}

When a client (User A) requests a signed exchange from a publisher, the
publisher could embed some information identifying that client into the exchange
they return. If User A then shares the signed exchange to User B, who opens it,
the publisher can learn that users A and B are connected. This doesn't allow the
publisher to track the intermediate hops if User A shares the exchange to User B
who then shares it to User C.

URL query parameters are routinely used today to identify when User A shares a
link to User B, and query parameters are more visible and easier for a browser
to analyze than differences in content, so we don't consider watermarked request
URLs part of the threat model for signed exchanges.

We also exclude from the threat model situations where User A intends to inform
the publisher that User B fetched their signed exchange from User A. User A can
inform the publisher more directly, without needing to use a watermark.

Several mitigations are available, none of which are clearly enough the right
answer yet to require them in this specification:

User A can reduce the risk by using a credential-less fetch to retrieve any
signed exchanges they intend to share. This doesn't completely eliminate the
risk, since User A probably made a previous credentialed request from the same
source IP address, and the publisher can embed a watermark identifying those
credentials.

If, instead of allowing the publisher to select the validity-url
({{signature-header}}) for each signature, we compute the validity-url from the
signed request URL, User B can check that their content matches the signatures
there. This requires publishers to include all signatures for acceptable
versions of the content at the computed validity-url, which gives space to hide
a signature for the IP-matched watermark if User A tries to use this method to
detect a watermark. It probably doesn't give space to serve signatures for all
possible watermarks to User B.

User A or B could check a transparency log, as envisioned by
{{uc-transparency}}, to detect that a publisher is watermarking their signed
exchanges. If the transparency log includes the actual exchanges, User A could
also use it to confuse the publisher's tracking.

User A could re-fetch the header of the signed exchange, up to the start of the
`signedHeaders` header field ({{application-signed-exchange}}), via an
anonymizing proxy, to identify whether their copy is watermarked. If the
publisher updates the signed exchange between the two requests, User A can retry
the earlier one.

# Use cases

## PUSHed subresources {#uc-pushed-subresources}

To reduce round trips, a server might use HTTP/2 Push (Section 8.2 of
{{?RFC7540}}) to inject a subresource from another server into the client's
cache. If anything about the subresource is expired or can't be verified, the
client would fetch it from the original server.

For example, if `https://example.com/index.html` includes

~~~html
<script src="https://jquery.com/jquery-1.2.3.min.js">
~~~

Then to avoid the need to look up and connect to `jquery.com` in the critical
path, `example.com` might push that resource signed by `jquery.com`.

## Explicit use of a content distributor for subresources {#uc-explicit-distributor}

In order to speed up loading but still maintain control over its content, an
HTML page in a particular origin `O.com` could tell clients to load its
subresources from an intermediate content distributor that's not authoritative,
but require that those resources be signed by `O.com` so that the distributor
couldn't modify the resources. This is more constrained than the common CDN case
where `O.com` has a CNAME granting the CDN the right to serve arbitrary content
as `O.com`.

~~~html
<img logicalsrc="https://O.com/img.png"
     physicalsrc="https://distributor.com/O.com/img.png">
~~~

To make it easier to configure the right distributor for a given request,
computation of the `physicalsrc` could be encapsulated in a custom element:

~~~html
<dist-img src="https://O.com/img.png"></dist-img>
~~~

where the `<dist-img>` implementation generates an appropriate `<img>` based on,
for example, a `<meta name="dist-base">` tag elsewhere in the page. However,
this has the downside that the
[preloader](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/big-bad-preloader/) can no
longer see the physical source to download it. The resulting delay might cancel
out the benefit of using a distributor.

This could be used for some of the same purposes as SRI ({{uc-sri}}).

To implement this with the current proposal, the distributor would respond to
the physical request to `https://distributor.com/O.com/img.png` with first a
signed PUSH_PROMISE for `https://O.com/img.png` and then a redirect to
`https://O.com/img.png`.

## Subresource Integrity {#uc-sri}

The W3C WebAppSec group is investigating
[using signatures](https://github.com/mikewest/signature-based-sri) in {{SRI}}.
They need a way to transmit the signature with the response, which this proposal
provides.

Their needs are simpler than most other use cases in that the
`integrity="ed25519-[public-key]"` attribute and CSP-based ways of expressing a
public key don't need that key to be wrapped into a certificate.

The "ed25519key" signature parameter supports this simpler way of attaching a
key.

The current proposal for signature-based SRI describes signing only the content
of a resource, while this specification requires them to sign the request URI as
well. This issue is tracked in
<https://github.com/mikewest/signature-based-sri/issues/5>. The details of what
they need to sign will affect whether and how they can use this proposal.

## Binary Transparency {#uc-transparency}

So-called "Binary Transparency" may eventually allow users to verify that a
program they've been delivered is one that's available to the public, and not a
specially-built version intended to attack just them. Binary transparency
systems don't exist yet, but they're likely to work similarly to the successful
Certificate Transparency logs described by {{?RFC6962}}.

Certificate Transparency depends on Signed Certificate Timestamps that prove a
log contained a particular certificate at a particular time. To build the same
thing for Binary Transparency logs containing HTTP resources or full websites,
we'll need a way to provide signatures of those resources, which signed
exchanges provides.

## Static Analysis {#uc-static-analysis}

Native app stores like the [Apple App
Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) and the [Android Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store) grant their contents powerful abilities,
which they attempt to make safe by analyzing the applications before offering
them to people. The web has no equivalent way for people to wait to run an
update of a web application until a trusted authority has vouched for it.

While full application analysis probably needs to wait until the authority can
sign bundles of exchanges, authorities may be able to guarantee certain
properties by just checking a top-level resource and its {{SRI}}-constrained
sub-resources.

## Offline websites {#uc-offline-websites}

Fully-offline websites can be represented as bundles of signed exchanges,
although an optimization to reduce the number of signature verifications may be
needed. Work on this is in progress in the <https://github.com/WICG/webpackage>
repository.

# Requirements

## Proof of origin

To verify that a thing came from a particular origin, for use in the same
context as a TLS connection, we need someone to vouch for the signing key with
as much verification as the signing keys used in TLS. The obvious way to do this
is to re-use the web PKI and CA ecosystem.

### Certificate constraints

If we re-use existing TLS server certificates, we incur the risks that:

1. TLS server certificates must be accessible from online servers, so they're
   easier to steal or use as signing oracles than an offline key. An exchange's
   signing key doesn't need to be online.
2. A server using an origin-trusted key for one purpose (e.g. TLS) might
   accidentally sign something that looks like an exchange, or vice versa.

These risks are considered too high, so we define a new X.509 certificate
extension in {{cross-origin-cert-req}} that requires CAs to issue new
certificates for this purpose. We expect at least one low-cost CA to be willing
to sign certificates with this extension.

### Signature constraints

In order to prevent an attacker who can convince the server to sign some
resource from causing those signed bytes to be interpreted as something else the
new X.509 extension here is forbidden from being used in TLS servers. If
{{cross-origin-cert-req}} changes to allow re-use in TLS servers, we would need
to:

1. Avoid key types that are used for non-TLS protocols whose output could be
   confused with a signature. That may be just the `rsaEncryption` OID from
   {{?RFC8017}}.
2. Use the same format as TLS's signatures, specified in Section 4.4.3 of
   {{?RFC8446}}, with a context string that's specific to this use.

The specification also needs to define which signing algorithm to use. It
currently specifies that as a function from the key type, instead of allowing
attacker-controlled data to specify it.

### Retrieving the certificate {#certificate-chain}

The client needs to be able to find the certificate vouching for the signing
key, a chain from that certificate to a trusted root, and possibly other trust
information like SCTs ({{?RFC6962}}). One approach would be to include the
certificate and its chain in the signature metadata itself, but this wastes
bytes when the same certificate is used for multiple HTTP responses. If we
decide to put the signature in an HTTP header, certificates are also unusually
large for that context.

Another option is to pass a URL that the client can fetch to retrieve the
certificate and chain. To avoid extra round trips in fetching that URL, it could
be [bundled](#uc-offline-websites) with the signed content or
[PUSHed](#uc-pushed-subresources) with it. The risks from the
`client_certificate_url` extension (Section 11.3 of {{RFC6066}}) don't seem to
apply here, since an attacker who can get a client to load an exchange and fetch
the certificates it references, can also get the client to perform those fetches
by loading other HTML.

To avoid using an unintended certificate with the same public key as the
intended one, the content of the leaf certificate or the chain should be
included in the signed data, like TLS does (Section 4.4.3 of
{{?RFC8446}}).

## How much to sign ## {#how-much-to-sign}

The previous {{?I-D.thomson-http-content-signature}} and
{{?I-D.burke-content-signature}} schemes signed just the content, while
({{?I-D.cavage-http-signatures}} could also sign the response headers and the
request method and path. However, the same path, response headers, and content
may mean something very different when retrieved from a different server.
{{serialized-headers}} currently includes the whole request URL in the
signature, but it's possible we need a more flexible scheme to allow some
higher-level protocols to accept a less-signed URL.

Servers might want to sign other request headers in order to capture their
effects on content negotiation. However, there's no standard algorithm to check
that a client's actual request headers match request headers sent by a server.
The most promising attempt at this is {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}, which
encodes the content negotiation algorithm into the `Variants` and `Variant-Key`
response headers. The proposal here ({{proposal}}) assumes that is in use and
doesn't sign request headers.

### Conveying the signed headers

HTTP headers are traditionally munged by proxies, making it impossible to
guarantee that the client will see the same sequence of bytes as the publisher
published. In the HTTPS world, we have more end-to-end header integrity, but
it's still likely that there are enough TLS-terminating proxies that the
publisher's signatures would tend to break before getting to the client.

There's no way in current HTTP for the response to a client-initiated request
(Section 8.1 of {{RFC7540}}) to convey the request headers it expected to
respond to, but we sidestep that by conveying content negotiation information in
response headers, per {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}.

Since proxies are unlikely to modify unknown content types, we can wrap the
original exchange into an `application/signed-exchange` format
({{application-signed-exchange}}) and include the `Cache-Control: no-transform`
header when sending it.

To reduce the likelihood of accidental modification by proxies, the
`application/signed-exchange` format includes a file signature that doesn't
collide with other known signatures.

To help the PUSHed subresources use case ({{uc-pushed-subresources}}), we might
also want to extend the `PUSH_PROMISE` frame type to include a signature, and
that could tell intermediates not to change the ensuing headers.

## Response lifespan

A normal HTTPS response is authoritative only for one client, for as long as its
cache headers say it should live. A signed exchange can be re-used for many
clients, and if it was generated while a server was compromised, it can continue
compromising clients even if their requests happen after the server recovers.
This signing scheme needs to mitigate that risk.

### Certificate revocation

Certificates are mis-issued and private keys are stolen, and in response clients
need to be able to stop trusting these certificates as promptly as possible.
Online revocation
checks [don't work](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html), so
the industry has moved to pushed revocation lists and stapled OCSP responses
{{?RFC6066}}.

Pushed revocation lists work as-is to block trust in the certificate signing an
exchange, but the signatures need an explicit strategy to staple OCSP responses.
One option is to extend the certificate download ({{certificate-chain}}) to
include the OCSP response too, perhaps in the
[TLS 1.3 CertificateEntry](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-tls13.html#ocsp-and-sct) format.

### Response downgrade attacks {#downgrade}

The signed content in a response might be vulnerable to attacks, such as XSS, or
might simply be discovered to be incorrect after publication. Once the author
fixes those vulnerabilities or mistakes, clients should stop trusting the old
signed content in a reasonable amount of time. Similar to certificate
revocation, I expect the best option to be stapled "this version is still valid"
assertions with short expiration times.

These assertions could be structured as:

1. A signed minimum version number or timestamp for a set of request headers:
   This requires that signed responses need to include a version number or
   timestamp, but allows a server to provide a single signature covering all
   valid versions.
1. A replacement for the whole exchange's signature. This requires the publisher to
   separately re-sign each valid version and requires each version to include a
   different update URL, but allows intermediates to serve less data. This is
   the approach taken in {{proposal}}.
1. A replacement for the exchange's signature and an update for the embedded
   `expires` and related cache-control HTTP headers {{?RFC7234}}. This naturally
   extends publishers' intuitions about cache expiration and the existing cache
   revalidation behavior to signed exchanges. This is sketched and its downsides
   explored in {{validity-with-cache-control}}.

The signature also needs to include instructions to intermediates for how to
fetch updated validity assertions.

## Low implementation complexity

Simpler implementations are, all things equal, less likely to include bugs. This
section describes decisions that were made in the rest of the specification to
reduce complexity.

### Limited choices

In general, we're trying to eliminate unnecessary choices in the specification.
For example, instead of requiring clients to support two methods for verifying
payload integrity, we only require one.

### Bounded-buffering integrity checking

Clients can be designed with a more-trusted network layer that decides how to
trust resources and then provides those resources to less-trusted rendering
processes along with handles to the storage and other resources they're allowed
to access. If the network layer can enforce that it only operates on chunks of
data up to a certain size, it can avoid the complexity of spooling large files
to disk.

To allow the network layer to verify signed exchanges using a bounded amount of
memory, {{application-signed-exchange}} requires the signature to be less than
16kB and the headers to be less than 512kB, and {{signature-validity}} requires
that the MI record size be less than 16kB. This allows the network layer to
validate a bounded chunk at a time, and pass that chunk on to a renderer, and
then forget about that chunk before processing the next one.

The `Digest` header field from {{!RFC3230}} requires the network layer to buffer
the entire response body, so it's disallowed.

# Determining validity using cache control # {#validity-with-cache-control}

This draft could expire signature validity using the normal HTTP cache control
headers ({{?RFC7234}}) instead of embedding an expiration date in the signature
itself. This section specifies how that would work, and describes why I haven't
chosen that option.

The signatures in the `Signature` header field ({{signature-header}}) would no
longer contain "date" or "expires" fields.

The validity-checking algorithm ({{signature-validity}}) would initialize `date`
from the resource's `Date` header field (Section 7.1.1.2 of {{?RFC7231}}) and
initialize `expires` from either the `Expires` header field (Section 5.3 of
{{?RFC7234}}) or the `Cache-Control` header field's `max-age` directive (Section
5.2.2.8 of {{?RFC7234}}) (added to `date`), whichever is present, preferring
`max-age` (or failing) if both are present.

Validity updates ({{updating-validity}}) would include a list of replacement
response header fields. For each header field name in this list, the client
would remove matching header fields from the stored exchange's response header
fields. Then the client would append the replacement header fields to the stored
exchange's response header fields.

## Example of updating cache control

For example, given a stored exchange of:

~~~http
GET  / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Expires: Sun, 26 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC

<!doctype html>
<html>
...
~~~

And an update listing the following headers:

~~~http
Expires: Fri, 1 Dec 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC
~~~

The resulting stored exchange would be:

~~~http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/html
Expires: Fri, 1 Dec 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC

<!doctype html>
<html>
...
~~~

## Downsides of updating cache control ## {#downsides-of-cache-control}

In an exchange with multiple signatures, using cache control to expire
signatures forces all signatures to initially live for the same period. Worse,
the update from one signature's "validity-url" might not match the update for
another signature. Clients would need to maintain a current set of headers for
each signature, and then decide which set to use when actually parsing the
resource itself.

This need to store and reconcile multiple sets of headers for a single signed
exchange argues for embedding a signature's lifetime into the signature.

RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS SECTION.

draft-06

* Add a security consideration for future-dated OCSP responses and for stolen
  private keys.
* Define a CAA parameter to opt into certificate issuance.
* Limit certificate lifetimes to 90 days.
* Add a privacy consideration about watermarking.

draft-05

* Define absolute URLs, and limit the schemes each instance can use.
* Fill in TBD size limits.
* Update to mice-03 including the Digest header.
* Refer to draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl for draft version

* Define the "integrity" field of the Signature header to include subfields of
  the main integrity-protecting header, including the digest algorithm.
* Put a fallback URL at the beginning of the `application/signed-exchange`
  format, which replaces the ':url' key from the CBOR representation of the
  exchange's request and response metadata and headers.
* Remove the rest of the request headers from the signed data, in favor of
  representing content negotiation with the `Variants` response header.
* Make the signed message format a concatenation of byte sequences, which helps
  implementations avoid re-serializing the exchange's request and response
  metadata and headers.

  client did it elsewhere in processing the response.
* Reject uncached header fields.
* Update to draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-09.

draft-04

* Update to draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-06.
* Replace the application/http-exchange+cbor format with a simpler
  application/signed-exchange format that:
  * Doesn't require a streaming CBOR parser parse it from a network stream.
  * Doesn't allow request payloads or response trailers, which don't fit into
    the signature model.
  * Allows checking the signature before parsing the exchange headers.
* Require absolute URLs.
* Make all identifiers in headers lower-case, as required by Structured Headers.
* Switch back to the TLS 1.3 signature format.
* Include the version and draft number in the signature context string.

  `allResponseHeaders` flag.
* Describe footguns around signing private content, and block certain headers to
  make it less likely.
* Define a CBOR structure to hold the certificate chain instead of re-using the
  TLS1.3 message. The TLS 1.3 parser fails on unexpected extensions while this
  format should ignore them, and apparently TLS implementations don't expose
  their message parsers enough to allow passing a message to a certificate
  verifier.
* Require an X.509 extension for the signing certificate.

draft-02

* Signatures identify a header (e.g. Digest or MI) to guard the payload's
  integrity instead of directly signing over the payload.

  and which ones.
* Define an `application/http-exchange+cbor` format to fetch signed exchanges
  without HTTP/2 Push.
* 2 new use cases.
