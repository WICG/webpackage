# Packaging Websites

Not to be confused with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), this repository
holds a collection of specifications aimed at packaging websites. These
specifications replace the ~~[W3C TAG's Web Packaging
Draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/)~~ and will allow people
to bundle together the resources that make up a website, so they can be shared
offline, either with or without a proof that they came from the original
website. A full list of use cases and resulting requirements is available in
[draft-yasskin-wpack-use-cases](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-use-cases.html)
([IETF
draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-wpack-use-cases)).

## Explainers

The [explainers](explainers/) walk through how to use these specs to
achieve the use cases.

### Use cases

* [Packaging whole pages or sites](explainers/authoritative-site-sharing.md): can be
  signed or unsigned.
   * [Serving signed subresources of a signed top-level HTML
     page](explainers/signed-exchange-subresource-substitution.md)
   * [Navigating to top-level unsigned pages](explainers/navigation-to-unsigned-bundles.md)
* [Packaging subresources](explainers/subresource-loading.md). This can include groups of
  JS modules, stylesheets, images, or fonts. This is also getting fleshed out at
  https://github.com/littledan/resource-bundles/

### Maintaining security and privacy constraints

* [How to avoid third-party tracking](explainers/anti-tracking.md)
* [What origin does an unsigned bundle have?](explainers/bundle-urls-and-origins.md)

## Specifications

The specifications come in several layers:

1. [Signed HTTP exchanges (a.k.a. SXG)](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html)
   ([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses)):
   These allow a browser to trust that a single HTTP request/response pair was
   generated by the origin it claims.
   * As we implement and test signed exchanges, we're publishing periodic
     snapshots so that browsers, publishers, and intermediates can synchronize
     on the same format. The [current implementation snapshot
     ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl)
     is an Internet Draft, and a [draft of the next
     snapshot](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl.html)
     is in this repository.
1. [Web Bundles (previously called Bundled HTTP exchanges)](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html)
   ([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges)):
   A collection of HTTP resources, each of which could be signed or unsigned, with
   some metadata describing how to interpret the bundle as a whole. This
   specification has an initial draft in a PR, but isn't finished yet. This work
   may proceed through either the IETF or the W3C/WHATWG.
1. [Loading](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/loading.html): A description of
   how browsers load signed and bundled exchanges. This is initially specified
   here, and will eventually merge into the appropriate specs, e.g.
   [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), that live in either the W3C or
   WHATWG. Currently this only covers signed exchanges.

A previous draft of the format combined layers 1 and 2 into a single format for
signed packages:
[draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging.html)
([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging)).
The DISPATCH WG at IETF99
[recommended](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-99-dispatch/) the current
split.

## Building this repository

### Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have software installed as described in
https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SETUP.md.

### Packaging tools

#### Signed HTTP Exchanges

Install this with `go install github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/signedexchange/cmd/...`.

See [go/signedexchange](go/signedexchange) for the usage of the tool.

#### Web Bundles

There are several tools.

- Go (Reference Implementation)

  Install this with `go install github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/bundle/cmd/...`.

  See [go/bundle](go/bundle) for the usage of the tool.

- Node

  There is a npm package, [wbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wbn).

- Plugin for bundlers (Experimental)

  - [Rollup plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/rollup-plugin-webbundle)
  - [Webpack plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/webbundle-webpack-plugin)

- Rust (Experimental)

  - [google/webbundle](https://github.com/google/webbundle)
