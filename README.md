# Packaging Websites

Not to be confused with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), this repository
holds a collection of specifications aimed at packaging websites. These
specifications replace the ~~[W3C TAG's Web Packaging
Draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/)~~ and will allow people
to bundle together the resources that make up a website, so they can be shared
offline, either with or without a proof that they came from the original
website. A full list of use cases and resulting requirements is available in
[draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases.html)
([IETF
draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases)).
The [explainer](explainer.md) walks through how to use these specs for to
achieve the use cases.

The specifications come in a couple layers:

1. [Signed HTTP exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html)
   ([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses)):
   These allow a browser to trust that a single HTTP request/response pair was
   generated by the origin it claims.
   * As we implement and test signed exchanges, we're publishing periodic
     snapshots so that browsers, publishers, and intermediates can synchronize
     on the same format. The [current implementation snapshot
     ](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl)
     is an Internet Draft, and a [draft of the next
     snapshot](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl.html)
     is in this repository.
1. [Bundled HTTP exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges.html)
   ([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges):
   A collection of exchanges, each of which could be signed or unsigned, with
   some metadata describing how to interpret the bundle as a whole. This
   specification has an initial draft in a PR, but isn't finished yet. This work
   may proceed through either the IETF or the W3C/WHATWG.
1. Loading: A description of how browsers load signed and bundled exchanges.
   This will be initially specified in the WICG and then will merge into the
   appropriate specs, e.g. [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), that live in
   either the W3C or WHATWG. Currently we only have a [sketch](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/blob/master/explainer.md#signed-exchange-loading-sketch)
   for signed exchange cases.

A previous draft of the format combined layers 1 and 2 into a single format for
signed packages:
[draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging.html)
([IETF draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging)).
The DISPATCH WG at IETF99
[recommended](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-99-dispatch/) the current
split.

## Building this repository

### Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have software installed as described in
https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md.

### Packaging tool.

Install this with `go install github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/signedexchange/cmd/gen-signedexchange`.

This tool is not yet documented well, but you can refer to
[README](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/test/data/htxg/README)
in Chromium's code repository to see how to generate necessary files for
testing.
