# Packaging Websites

Not to be confused with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), this repository
holds a collection of specifications aimed at packaging websites. These
specifications replace the ~~[W3C TAG's Web Packaging
Draft](https://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/)~~ and will allow people
to bundle together the resources that make up a website, so they can be shared
offline, either with or without a proof that they came from the original
website. A full list of use cases and resulting requirements is available in
[draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases)
([Editor's
draft](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-webpackage-use-cases.html)).
The [explainer](explainer.md) walks through how to use these specs for to
achieve the use cases.

The specifications come in a couple layers:

1. [Signed HTTP exchanges](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses)
   ([Editor's draft](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html)):
   These allow a browser to trust that a single HTTP request/response pair was
   generated by the origin it claims.
1. [Bundled HTTP exchanges](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/pull/98): A
   collection of exchanges, each of which could be signed or unsigned, with some
   metadata describing how to interpret the bundle as a whole. This
   specification has an initial draft in a PR, but isn't finished yet. This work
   may proceed through either the IETF or the W3C/WHATWG.
1. Loading: A description of how browsers load signed and bundled exchanges.
   This will be initially specified in the WICG and then will merge into the
   appropriate specs, e.g. [Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/), that live in
   either the W3C or WHATWG.

A previous draft of the format combined layers 1 and 2 into a single format for
signed packages:
[draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging)
([Editor's draft](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-dispatch-web-packaging.html)).
The DISPATCH WG at IETF99
[recommended](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-99-dispatch/) the current
split.

## Building this repository

### Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have software installed as described in
https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md.

### Packaging tool.

Install this with `go install github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/signed-exchange/cmd/gen-signedexchange`.
This tool is not yet documented well.
