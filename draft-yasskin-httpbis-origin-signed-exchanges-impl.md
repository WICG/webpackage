--- abstract

This document specifies how a server can send an HTTP request/response pair,
known as an exchange, with signatures that vouch for that exchange's
authenticity. These signatures can be verified against an origin's certificate
to establish that the exchange is authoritative for an origin even if it was
transferred over a connection that isn't. The signatures can also be used in
other ways described in the appendices.

These signatures contain countermeasures against downgrade and
protocol-confusion attacks.

# Introduction

Signed HTTP exchanges provide a way to prove the authenticity of a resource in
cases where the transport layer isn't sufficient. This can be used in several
ways:

* When signed by a certificate ({{?RFC5280}}) that's trusted for an origin, an
  exchange can be treated as authoritative for that origin, even if it was
  transferred over a connection that isn't authoritative (Section 9.1 of
  {{?RFC7230}}) for that origin. See {{uc-pushed-subresources}} and
  {{uc-explicit-distributor}}.
* A top-level resource can use a public key to identify an expected author for
  particular subresources, a system known as Subresource Integrity ({{SRI}}). An
  exchange's signature provides the matching proof of authorship. See
  {{uc-sri}}.
* A signature can vouch for the exchange in some way, for example that it
  appears in a transparency log or that static analysis indicates that it omits
  certain attacks. See {{uc-transparency}} and {{uc-static-analysis}}.

Subsequent work toward the use cases in {{?I-D.yasskin-webpackage-use-cases}}
will provide a way to group signed exchanges into bundles that can be
transmitted and stored together, but single signed exchanges are useful enough
to standardize on their own.

# Terminology

Author
: The entity that controls the server for a particular origin {{?RFC6454}}. The
  author can get a CA to issue certificates for their private keys and can run a
  TLS server for their origin.

Exchange (noun)
: An HTTP request/response pair. This can either be a request from a client and
the matching response from a server or the request in a PUSH_PROMISE and its
matching response stream. Defined by Section 8 of {{!RFC7540}}.

Intermediate
: An entity that fetches signed HTTP exchanges from an author or another
  intermediate and forwards them to another intermediate or a client.

Client
: An entity that uses a signed HTTP exchange and needs to be able to prove that
  the author vouched for it as coming from its claimed origin.

Unix time
: Defined by {{POSIX}} [section
4.16](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Signing an exchange # {#proposal}

In the response of an HTTP exchange the server MAY include a `Signature` header
field ({{signature-header}}) holding a list of one or more parameterised
signatures that vouch for the content of the exchange. Exactly which content the
signature vouches for can depend on how the exchange is transferred
({{transfer}}).

The client categorizes each signature as "valid" or "invalid" by validating that
signature with its certificate or public key and other metadata against the
exchange's headers and content ({{signature-validity}}). This validity then
informs higher-level protocols.

Each signature is parameterised with information to let a client fetch assurance
that a signed exchange is still valid, in the face of revoked certificates and
newly-discovered vulnerabilities. This assurance can be bundled back into the
signed exchange and forwarded to another client, which won't have to re-fetch
this validity information for some period of time.

## The Signature Header ## {#signature-header}

The `Signature` header field conveys a list of signatures for an exchange, each
one accompanied by information about how to determine the authority of and
refresh that signature. Each signature directly signs the exchange's headers and
identifies one of those headers that enforces the integrity of the exchange's
payload.

The `Signature` header is a Structured Header as defined by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be a list (Section 4.8 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) of parameterised labels (Section 4.4 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}).

Each parameterised label MUST have parameters named "sig", "integrity",
"validityUrl", "date", and "expires". Each parameterised label MUST also have
either "certUrl" and "certSha256" parameters or an "ed25519Key" parameter. This
specification gives no meaning to the label itself, which can be used as a
human-readable identifier for the signature (see {{parameterised-binary}}). The
present parameters MUST have the following values:

"sig"

: Binary content (Section 4.5 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) holding
  the signature of most of these parameters and the exchange's headers.

"integrity"

: A string (Section 4.2 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) containing
  the lowercase name of the response header field that guards the response
  payload's integrity.

"certUrl"

: A string (Section 4.2 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) containing a
  [valid URL string](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#valid-url-string).

"certSha256"

: Binary content (Section 4.5 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) holding
  the SHA-256 hash of the first certificate found at "certUrl".

"ed25519Key"

: Binary content (Section 4.5 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) holding
  an Ed25519 public key ({{!RFC8032}}).

{:#signature-validityurl} "validityUrl"

: A string (Section 4.2 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) containing a
  [valid URL string](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#valid-url-string).

"date" and "expires"

: An unsigned integer (Section 4.1 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}})
  representing a Unix time.

The "certUrl" parameter is *not* signed, so intermediates can update it with a
pointer to a cached version.

### Examples ### {#example-signature-header}

The following header is included in the response for an exchange with effective
request URI `https://example.com/resource.html`. Newlines are added for
readability.

~~~

There are 4 signatures: 2 from different secp256r1 certificates within
`https://example.com/`, one using a raw ed25519 public key that's also
controlled by `example.com`, and a fourth using a secp256r1 certificate owned by
`thirdparty.example.com`.

All 4 signatures rely on the `MI` response header to guard the integrity of the
response payload. This isn't strictly required---some signatures could use `MI`
while others use `Digest`---but there's not much benefit to mixing them.

The signatures include a "validityUrl" that includes the first time the resource
was seen. This allows multiple versions of a resource at the same URL to be
updated with new signatures, which allows clients to avoid transferring extra
data while the old versions don't have known security bugs.

The certificates at `https://example.com/oldcerts` and
`https://example.com/newcerts` have `subjectAltName`s of `example.com`, meaning
that if they and their signatures validate, the exchange can be trusted as
having an origin of `https://example.com/`. The author might be using two
certificates because their readers have disjoint sets of roots in their trust
stores.

The author signed with all three certificates at the same time, so they share a validity range: 7 days starting at 2017-11-19 21:53 UTC.

The author then requested an additional signature from `thirdparty.example.com`,
which did some validation or processing and then signed the resource at
2017-11-19 23:11 UTC. `thirdparty.example.com` only grants 4-day signatures, so
clients will need to re-validate more often.

### Open Questions ### {#oq-signature-header}

{{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} provides a way to parameterise labels but
not other supported types like binary content. If the `Signature` header field
is notionally a list of parameterised signatures, maybe we should add a
"parameterised binary content" type.
{:#parameterised-binary}

Should the certUrl and validityUrl be lists so that intermediates can offer a
cache without losing the original URLs? Putting lists in dictionary fields is
more complex than {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} allows, so they're
single items for now.

## CBOR representation of exchange headers ## {#cbor-representation}

To sign an exchange's headers, they need to be serialized into a byte string.
Since intermediaries and [distributors](#uc-explicit-distributor) might
rearrange, add, or just reserialize headers, we can't use the literal bytes of
the headers as this serialization. Instead, this section defines a CBOR
representation that can be embedded into other CBOR, canonically serialized
({{canonical-cbor}}), and then signed.

The CBOR representation of an exchange `exchange`'s headers is the CBOR
({{!RFC7049}}) array with the following content:

1. The map mapping:
   * The byte string ':method' to the byte string containing `exchange`'s
     request's method.
   * The byte string ':url' to the byte string containing `exchange`'s request's
     effective request URI.
   * For each request header field in `exchange`, the header field's name as a
     byte string to the header field's value as a byte string.
1. The map mapping:
   * the byte string ':status' to the byte string containing `exchange`'s
     response's 3-digit status code, and
   * for each response header field in `exchange`, the header field's name as a
     byte string to the header field's value as a byte string.

### Example ### {#example-cbor-representation}

Given the HTTP exchange:

~~~http
GET https://example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/html
Digest: SHA-256=20addcf7368837f616d549f035bf6784ea6d4bf4817a3736cd2fc7a763897fe3
Signed-Headers: "content-type", "digest"

<!doctype html>
<html>
...
~~~

The cbor representation consists of the following item, represented using the
extended diagnostic notation from {{?I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}} appendix G:

~~~cbor-diag
[
  {
    ':url': 'https://example.com/'
    ':method': 'GET',
  },
  {
    'digest': 'SHA-256=20addcf7368837f616d549f035bf6784ea6d4bf4817a3736cd2fc7a763897fe3',
    ':status': '200',
    'content-type': 'text/html'
  }
]
~~~

## Loading a certificate chain ## {#cert-chain-format}

The resource at a signature's `certUrl` MUST have the
`application/cert-chain+cbor` content type, MUST be canonically-encoded CBOR
({{canonical-cbor}}), and MUST match the following CDDL:

~~~cddl
cert-chain = [
  "📜⛓", ; U+1F4DC U+26D3
  + {
    cert: bytes,
    ? ocsp: bytes,
    ? sct: bytes,
    * tstr => any,
  }
]
~~~

The first item in the CBOR array is treated as the end-entity certificate, and
the client will attempt to build a path ({{?RFC5280}}) to it from a trusted root
using the other certificates in the chain.

1. Each `cert` value MUST be a DER-encoded X.509v3 certificate ({{!RFC5280}}).
   Other key/value pairs in the same array item define properties of this
   certificate.
1. The first certificate's `ocsp` value if any MUST be a complete, DER-encoded
   OCSP response for that certificate (using the ASN.1 type `OCSPResponse`
   defined in {{!RFC2560}}). Subsequent certificates MUST NOT have an `ocsp`
   value.
1. Each certificate's `sct` value MUST be a `SignedCertificateTimestampList` for
   that certificate as defined by Section 3.3 of {{!RFC6962}}.

Loading a `certUrl` takes a `forceFetch` flag. The client MUST:

1. Let `raw-chain` be the result of fetching ({{FETCH}}) `certUrl`. If
   `forceFetch` is *not* set, the fetch can be fulfilled from a cache using
   normal HTTP semantics {{!RFC7234}}. If this fetch fails, return
   "invalid".
1. Let `certificate-chain` be the array of certificates and properties produced
   by parsing `raw-chain` using the CDDL above. If any of the requirements above
   aren't satisfied, return "invalid". Note that this validation requirement
   might be impractical to completely achieve due to certificate validation
   implementations that don't enforce DER encoding or other standard
   constraints.
1. Return `certificate-chain`.

## Canonical CBOR serialization ## {#canonical-cbor}

Within this specification, the canonical serialization of a CBOR item uses the
following rules derived from Section 3.9 of {{?RFC7049}} with erratum 4964
applied:

* Integers and the lengths of arrays, maps, and strings MUST use the smallest
  possible encoding.
* Items MUST NOT be encoded with indefinite length.
* The keys in every map MUST be sorted in the bytewise lexicographic order of
  their canonical encodings. For example, the following keys are correctly sorted:
  1. 10, encoded as 0A.
  1. 100, encoded as 18 64.
  1. -1, encoded as 20.
  1. "z", encoded as 61 7A.
  1. "aa", encoded as 62 61 61.
  1. \[100], encoded as 81 18 64.
  1. \[-1], encoded as 81 20.
  1. false, encoded as F4.

Note: this specification does not use floating point, tags, or other more
complex data types, so it doesn't need rules to canonicalize those.

## Signature validity ## {#signature-validity}

The client MUST parse the `Signature` header field as the list of parameterised
values (Section 4.8.1 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) described in
{{signature-header}}. If an error is thrown during this parsing or any of the
requirements described there aren't satisfied, the exchange has no valid
signatures. Otherwise, each member of this list represents a signature with
parameters.

The client MUST use the following algorithm to determine whether each signature
with parameters is invalid or potentially-valid for an `exchange`.
Potentially-valid results include:

* The signed headers of the exchange so that higher-level protocols can avoid
  relying on unsigned headers, and
* Either a certificate chain or a public key so that a higher-level protocol can
  determine whether it's actually valid.

This algorithm accepts a `forceFetch` flag that avoids the cache when fetching
URLs. A client that determines that a potentially-valid certificate chain is
actually invalid due to an expired OCSP response MAY retry with `forceFetch` set
to retrieve an updated OCSP from the original server.
{:#force-fetch}

1. Let `payload` be the payload body (Section 3.3 of {{!RFC7230}}) of
   `exchange`. Note that the payload body is the message body with any transfer
   encodings removed.
1. Let:
   * `signature` be the signature (binary content in the parameterised label's
     "sig" parameter).
   * `integrity` be the signature's "integrity" parameter.
   * `validityUrl` be the signature's "validityUrl" parameter.
   * `certUrl` be the signature's "certUrl" parameter, if any.
   * `certSha256` be the signature's "certSha256" parameter, if any.
   * `ed25519Key` be the signature's "ed25519Key" parameter, if any.
   * `date` be the signature's "date" parameter, interpreted as a Unix time.
   * `expires` be the signature's "expires" parameter, interpreted as a Unix
     time.
1. If `integrity` names a header field that is not present in `exchange`'s
   response headers or which the client cannot use to check the integrity of
   `payload` (for example, the header field is new and hasn't been implemented
   yet), then return "invalid". Clients MUST implement at least the `Digest`
   ({{!RFC3230}}) and `MI` ({{!I-D.thomson-http-mice}}) header fields.
1. If `integrity` is "digest", and the `Digest` header field in `exchange`'s
   response headers contains no digest-algorithms
   (<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-dig-alg/http-dig-alg.xhtml>) stronger
   than `SHA`, then return "invalid".
1. Set `publicKey` and `signing-alg` depending on which key fields are present:
   1. If `certUrl` is present:
      1. Let `certificate-chain` be the result of loading the certificate chain
         at `certUrl` passing the `forceFetch` flag ({{cert-chain-format}}). If
         this returns "invalid", return "invalid".
      1. Let `main-certificate` be the first certificate in `certificate-chain`.
      1. Set `publicKey` to `main-certificate`'s public key.
      1. The client MUST define a partial function from public key types to
         signing algorithms, and this function must at the minimum include the
         following mappings:

         RSA, 2048 bits:
         : rsa_pss_rsae_sha256 or rsa_pss_pss_sha256, as defined in Section
           4.2.3 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, depending on which of the
           rsaEncryption OID or RSASSA-PSS OID {{!RFC8017}} is used.

         EC, with the secp256r1 curve:
         : ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256 as defined in Section 4.2.3 of
           {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.

         EC, with the secp384r1 curve:
         : ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384 as defined in Section 4.2.3 of
           {{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.

         Set `signing-alg` to the result of applying this function to the type of
         `main-certificate`'s public key. If the function is undefined on this
         input, return "invalid".
   1. If `ed25519Key` is present, set `publicKey` to `ed25519Key` and
      `signing-alg` to ed25519, as defined by {{!RFC8032}}
1. If `expires` is more than 7 days (604800 seconds) after `date`, return
   "invalid".
1. If the current time is before `date` or after `expires`, return "invalid".
1. Let `message` be the concatenation of the following byte strings:
   1. A context string: the ASCII encoding of “HTTP Exchange”.
   1. A single 0 byte which serves as a separator.
   1. The bytes of the canonical CBOR serialization ({{canonical-cbor}}) of a
      CBOR map mapping:
      1. If `certSha256` is set:
         1. The text string "certSha256" to the byte string value of
            `certSha256`.
      1. The text string "validityUrl" to the byte string value of
         `validityUrl`.
      1. The text string "date" to the integer value of `date`.
      1. The text string "expires" to the integer value of `expires`.
      1. The text string "headers" to the CBOR representation
         ({{cbor-representation}}) of `exchange`'s headers.
1. If `certUrl` is present and the SHA-256 hash of `main-certificate`'s
   `cert_data` is not equal to `certSha256` (whose presence was checked when the
   `Signature` header field was parsed), return "invalid".

   Note that this intentionally differs from TLS 1.3, which signs the entire
   certificate chain in its Certificate Verify (Section 4.4.3 of
   {{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}), in order to allow updating the stapled OCSP
   response without updating signatures at the same time.
1. If `signature` is a valid signature of `message` by `publicKey` using
   `signing-alg`, return "potentially-valid" with whichever is present of
   `certificate-chain` or `ed25519Key`. Otherwise, return "invalid".

Note that the above algorithm can determine that an exchange's headers are
potentially-valid before the exchange's payload is received. Similarly, if
`integrity` identifies a header field like `MI` ({{?I-D.thomson-http-mice}})
that can incrementally validate the payload, early parts of the payload can be
determined to be potentially-valid before later parts of the payload.
Higher-level protocols MAY process parts of the exchange that have been
determined to be potentially-valid as soon as that determination is made but
MUST NOT process parts of the exchange that are not yet potentially-valid.
Similarly, as the higher-level protocol determines that parts of the exchange
are actually valid, the client MAY process those parts of the exchange and MUST
wait to process other parts of the exchange until they too are determined to be
valid.

### Open Questions ### {#oq-signature-validity}

Should the signed message use the TLS format (with an initial 64 spaces) even
though these certificates can't be used in TLS servers?

## Updating signature validity ## {#updating-validity}

Both OCSP responses and signatures are designed to expire a short
time after they're signed, so that revoked certificates and signed exchanges
with known vulnerabilities are distrusted promptly.

This specification provides no way to update OCSP responses by themselves.
Instead, [clients need to re-fetch the "certUrl"](#force-fetch) to get a chain
including a newer OCSP response.

The ["validityUrl" parameter](#signature-validityurl) of the signatures provides
a way to fetch new signatures or learn where to fetch a complete updated
exchange.

Each version of a signed exchange SHOULD have its own validity URLs, since each
version needs different signatures and becomes obsolete at different times.

The resource at a "validityUrl" is "validity data", a CBOR map matching the
following CDDL ({{!I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}):

~~~cddl
validity = {
  ? signatures: [ + bytes ]
  ? update: {
    ? size: uint,
  }
]
~~~

The elements of the `signatures` array are parameterised labels (Section 4.4 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) meant to replace the signatures within
the `Signature` header field pointing to this validity data. If the signed
exchange contains a bug severe enough that clients need to stop using the
content, the `signatures` array MUST NOT be present.

If the the `update` map is present, that indicates that a new version of the
signed exchange is available at its effective request URI (Section 5.5 of
{{!RFC7230}}) and can give an estimate of the size of the updated exchange
(`update.size`). If the signed exchange is currently the most recent version,
the `update` SHOULD NOT be present.

If both the `signatures` and `update` fields are present, clients can use the
estimated size to decide whether to update the whole resource or just its
signatures.

### Examples ### {#examples-updating-validity}

For example, say a signed exchange whose URL is `https://example.com/resource`
has the following `Signature` header field (with line breaks included and
irrelevant fields omitted for ease of reading).

~~~http
Signature:
 sig1;
  sig=*MEUCIQ...;
  ...
  validityUrl="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180";
  certUrl="https://example.com/oldcerts";
  date=1511128380; expires=1511733180,
 sig2;
  sig=*MEQCIG...;
  ...
  validityUrl="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180";
  certUrl="https://example.com/newcerts";
  date=1511128380; expires=1511733180,
 thirdpartysig;
  sig=*MEYCIQ...;
  ...
  validityUrl="https://thirdparty.example.com/resource.validity.1511161860";
  certUrl="https://thirdparty.example.com/certs";
  date=1511478660; expires=1511824260
~~~

At 2017-11-27 11:02 UTC, `sig1` and `sig2` have expired, but `thirdpartysig`
doesn't exipire until 23:11 that night, so the client needs to fetch
`https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180` (the `validityUrl` of `sig1`
and `sig2`) to update those signatures. This URL might contain:

~~~cbor-diag
{
  "signatures": [
    'sig1; '
    'sig=*MEQCIC/I9Q+7BZFP6cSDsWx43pBAL0ujTbON/+7RwKVk+ba5AiB3FSFLZqpzmDJ0NumNwN04pqgJZE99fcK86UjkPbj4jw; '
    'validityUrl="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180"; '
    'integrity="mi"; '
    'certUrl="https://example.com/newcerts"; '
    'certSha256=*J/lEm9kNRODdCmINbvitpvdYKNQ+YgBj99DlYp4fEXw; '
    'date=1511733180; expires=1512337980'
  ],
  "update": {
    "size": 5557452
  }
}
~~~

This indicates that the client could fetch a newer version at
`https://example.com/resource` (the original URL of the exchange), or that the
validity period of the old version can be extended by replacing the first two of
the original signatures (the ones with a validityUrl of
`https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180`) with the single new
signature provided. (This might happen at the end of a migration to a new root
certificate.) The signatures of the updated signed exchange would be:

~~~http
Signature:
 sig1;
  sig=*MEQCIC...;
  ...
  validityUrl="https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180";
  certUrl="https://example.com/newcerts";
  date=1511733180; expires=1512337980,
 thirdpartysig;
  sig=*MEYCIQ...;
  ...
  validityUrl="https://thirdparty.example.com/resource.validity.1511161860";
  certUrl="https://thirdparty.example.com/certs";
  date=1511478660; expires=1511824260
~~~

`https://example.com/resource.validity.1511157180` could also expand the set of
signatures if its `signatures` array contained more than 2 elements.

## The Accept-Signature header ## {#accept-signature}

`Signature` header fields cost on the order of 300 bytes for ECDSA signatures,
so servers might prefer to avoid sending them to clients that don't intend to
use them. A client can send the `Accept-Signature` header field to indicate that
it does intend to take advantage of any available signatures and to indicate
what kinds of signatures it supports.

When a server receives an `Accept-Signature` header field in a client request,
it SHOULD reply with any available `Signature` header fields for its response
that the `Accept-Signature` header field indicates the client supports. However,
if the `Accept-Signature` value violates a requirement in this section, the
server MUST behave as if it hadn't received any `Accept-Signature` header at
all.

The `Accept-Signature` header field is a Structured Header as defined by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be a list (Section 4.8 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) of parameterised labels (Section 4.4 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}). The order of labels in the
`Accept-Signature` list is not significant. Labels, ignoring any initial "-"
character, MUST NOT be duplicated.

Each label in the `Accept-Signature` header field's value indicates that a
feature of the `Signature` header field ({{signature-header}}) is supported. If
the label begins with a "-" character, it instead indicates that the feature
named by the rest of the label is not supported. Unknown labels and parameters
MUST be ignored because new labels and new parameters on existing labels may be
defined by future specifications.

### Integrity labels ### {#accept-signature-integrity}

Labels starting with "digest/" indicate that the client supports the `Digest`
header field ({{!RFC3230}}) with the digest-algorithm from the
<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-dig-alg/http-dig-alg.xhtml> registry
named in lower-case by the rest of the label. For example, "digest/sha-512"
indicates support for the SHA-512 digest algorithm, and "-digest/sha-256"
indicates non-support for the SHA-256 digest algorithm.

Labels starting with "mi/" indicate that the client supports the `MI` header
field ({{!I-D.thomson-http-mice}}) with the parameter from the HTTP MI Parameter
Registry registry named in lower-case by the rest of the label. For example,
"mi/mi-blake2" indicates support for Merkle integrity with the
as-yet-unspecified mi-blake2 parameter, and "-digest/mi-sha256" indicates
non-support for Merkle integrity with the mi-sha256 content encoding.

If the `Accept-Signature` header field is present, servers SHOULD assume support
for "digest/sha-256" and "mi/mi-sha256" unless the header field states
otherwise.

### Key type labels ### {#accept-signature-key-types}

Labels starting with "rsa/" indicate that the client supports certificates
holding RSA public keys with a number of bits indicated by the digits after the
"/".

Labels starting with "ecdsa/" indicate that the client supports certificates
holding ECDSA public keys on the curve named in lower-case by the rest of the
label.

If the `Accept-Signature` header field is present, servers SHOULD assume support
for "rsa/2048", "ecdsa/secp256r1", and "ecdsa/secp384r1" unless the header field
states otherwise.

### Key value labels ### {#accept-signature-key-values}

The "ed25519key" label has parameters indicating the public keys that will be
used to validate the returned signature. Each parameter's name is re-interpreted
as binary content (Section 4.5 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}})
encoding a prefix of the public key. For example, if the
client will validate signatures using the public key whose base64 encoding is
`11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo`, valid `Accept-Signature` header fields include:

~~~http
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYAYKxCrfVS/7TyWQHOg
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYAQ
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *
~~~

but not

~~~http
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; *11qYA
~~~

because 5 bytes isn't a valid length for encoded base64, and not

~~~http
Accept-Signature: ..., ed25519key; 11qYAQ
~~~

because it doesn't start with the `*` that indicates binary content.

Note that `ed25519key; *` is an empty prefix, which matches all public keys, so
it's useful in subresource integrity ({{uc-sri}}) cases like `<link rel=preload
as=script href="...">` where the public key isn't known until the matching
`<script src="..." integrity="...">` tag.

### Examples ### {#accept-signature-examples}

~~~http
Accept-Signature: mi/mi-sha256
~~~

states that the client will accept signatures with payload integrity assured by
the `MI` header and `mi-sha256` content encoding and implies that the client
will accept integrity assured by the `Digest: SHA-256` header and signatures
from 2048-bit RSA keys and ECDSA keys on the secp256r1 and secp384r1 curves.

~~~http
Accept-Signature: -rsa/2048, rsa/4096
~~~

states that the client will accept 4096-bit RSA keys but not 2048-bit RSA keys,
and implies that the client will accept ECDSA keys on the secp256r1 and
secp384r1 curves and payload integrity assured with the `MI: mi-sha256` and
`Digest: SHA-256` header fields.

### Open Questions ### {#oq-accept-signature}

Is an `Accept-Signature` header useful enough to pay for itself? If clients wind
up sending it on most requests, that may cost more than the cost of sending
`Signature`s unconditionally. On the other hand, it gives servers an indication
of which kinds of signatures are supported, which can help us upgrade the
ecosystem in the future.

Is `Accept-Signature` the right spelling, or do we want to imitate `Want-Digest`
(Section 4.3.1 of {{?RFC3230}}) instead?

Do I have the right structure for the labels indicating feature support?

# Cross-origin trust {#cross-origin-trust}

To determine whether to trust a cross-origin exchange, the client takes a
`Signature` header field ({{signature-header}}) and the `exchange`. The client
MUST parse the `Signature` header into a list of signatures according to the
instructions in {{signature-validity}}, and run the following algorithm for each
signature, stopping at the first one that returns "valid". If any signature
returns "valid", return "valid". Otherwise, return "invalid".

1. If the signature's ["validityUrl" parameter](#signature-validityurl) is not
   [same-origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#same-origin)
   with `exchange`'s effective request URI (Section 5.5 of {{!RFC7230}}), return
   "invalid".
1. Use {{signature-validity}} to determine the signature's validity for
   `exchange`, getting `certificate-chain` back. If this returned "invalid" or
   didn't return a certificate chain, return "invalid".
1. If `exchange`'s request method is not safe (Section 4.2.1 of {{!RFC7231}}) or
   not cacheable (Section 4.2.3 of {{!RFC7231}}), return "invalid".
1. If `exchange`'s headers contain a stateful header field, as defined in
   {{stateful-headers}}, return "invalid".
1. Let `authority` be the host component of `exchange`'s effective request URI.
1. Validate the `certificate-chain` using the following substeps. If any of them
   fail, re-run {{signature-validity}} once over the signature with the
   `forceFetch` flag set, and restart from step 2. If a substep fails again,
   return "invalid".
   1. Use `certificate-chain` to validate that its first entry,
      `main-certificate` is trusted as `authority`'s server certificate
      ({{!RFC5280}} and other undocumented conventions). Let `path` be the path
      that was used from the `main-certificate` to a trusted root, including the
      `main-certificate` but excluding the root.
   1. Validate that `main-certificate` has the CanSignHttpExchanges extension
      ({{cross-origin-cert-req}}).
   1. Validate that `main-certificate` has an `ocsp` property
      ({{cert-chain-format}}) with a valid OCSP response whose lifetime
      (`nextUpdate - thisUpdate`) is less than 7 days ({{!RFC6960}}). Note that
      this does not check for revocation of intermediate certificates, and
      clients SHOULD implement another mechanism for that.
   1. Validate that `main-certificate` has an `sct` property
      ({{cert-chain-format}}) containing valid SCTs from trusted logs.
      ({{!RFC6962}})
1. Return "valid".

## Stateful header fields {#stateful-headers}

As described in {{seccons-over-signing}}, a publisher can cause problems if they
sign an exchange that includes private information. There's no way for a client
to be sure an exchange does or does not include private information, but header
fields that store or convey stored state in the client are a good sign.

A stateful request header field informs the server of per-client state. These
include but are not limited to:

* `Authorization`, {{?RFC7235}}
* `Cookie`, {{?RFC6265}}
* `Cookie2`, {{?RFC2965}}
* `Proxy-Authorization`, {{?RFC7235}}
* `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, {{?RFC6455}}

A stateful response header field modifies state, including authentication
status, in the client. The HTTP cache is not considered part of this state.
These include but are not limited to:

* `Authentication-Control`, {{?RFC8053}}
* `Authentication-Info`, {{?RFC7615}}
* `Optional-WWW-Authenticate`, {{?RFC8053}}
* `Proxy-Authenticate`, {{?RFC7235}}
* `Proxy-Authentication-Info`, {{?RFC7615}}
* `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`, {{?RFC6455}}
* `Set-Cookie`, {{?RFC6265}}
* `Set-Cookie2`, {{?RFC2965}}
* `SetProfile`, {{?W3C.NOTE-OPS-OverHTTP}}
* `WWW-Authenticate`, {{?RFC7235}}

## Certificate Requirements {#cross-origin-cert-req}

We define a new X.509 extension, CanSignHttpExchanges to be used in the
certificate when the certificate permits the usage of signed exchanges.  When
this extension is not present the client MUST NOT accept a signature from the
certificate as proof that a signed exchange is authoritative for a domain
covered by the certificate. When it is present, the client MUST follow the
validation procedure in {{cross-origin-trust}}.

~~~asn.1
   id-ce-canSignHttpExchanges OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { TBD }

   CanSignHttpExchanges ::= BIT STRING { allowed (0) }
~~~

Leaf certificates without this extension need to be revoked if the private key
is exposed to an unauthorized entity, but they generally don't need to be
revoked if a signing oracle is exposed and then removed.

CA certificates, by contrast, need to be revoked if an unauthorized entity is
able to make even one unauthorized signature.

Certificates with this extension MUST be revoked if an unauthorized entity is
able to make even one unauthorized signature.

Conforming CAs MUST mark this extension as critical, and clients MUST NOT accept
certificates with this extension in TLS connections (Section 4.4.2.2 of
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}).  This prevents accidental signing oracles exposed by
TLS servers from allowing package signing (e.g. {{DROWN}} and {{ROBOT}}).

# Transferring a signed exchange {#transfer}

A signed exchange can be transferred in several ways, of which three are
described here.

## Same-origin response {#same-origin-response}

The signature for a signed exchange can be included in a normal HTTP response.
Because different clients send different request header fields, and intermediate
servers add response header fields, it can be impossible to have a signature for
the exact request and response that the client sees. Therefore, when a client
validates the `Signature` header field for an exchange represented as a normal
HTTP request/response pair, it MUST pass only the subset of header fields
defined by {{significant-headers}} to the validation procedure
({{signature-validity}}).

If the client relies on signature validity for any aspect of its behavior, it
MUST ignore any header fields that it didn't pass to the validation procedure.

### Significant headers for a same-origin response {#significant-headers}

The significant headers of an exchange represented as a normal HTTP
request/response pair (Section 2.1 of {{?RFC7230}} or Section 8.1 of
{{?RFC7540}}) are:

* The method (Section 4 of {{!RFC7231}}) and effective request URI (Section 5.5
  of {{!RFC7230}}) of the request.
* The response status code (Section 6 of {{!RFC7231}}) and the response header
  fields whose names are listed in that exchange's `Signed-Headers` header field
  ({{signed-headers}}), in the order they appear in that header field. If a
  response header field name from `Signed-Headers` does not appear in the
  exchange's response header fields, the exchange has no significant headers.

If the exchange's `Signed-Headers` header field is not present, doesn't parse as
a Structured Header ({{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) or doesn't follow
the constraints on its value described in {{signed-headers}}, the exchange has
no significant headers.

#### Open Questions {#oq-significant-headers}

Do the significant headers of an exchange need to include the `Signed-Headers`
header field itself?

### The Signed-Headers Header {#signed-headers}

The `Signed-Headers` header field identifies an ordered list of response header
fields to include in a signature. The request URL and response status are
included unconditionally. This allows a TLS-terminating intermediate to reorder
headers without breaking the signature. This *can* also allow the intermediate
to add headers that will be ignored by some higher-level protocols, but
{{signature-validity}} provides a hook to let other higher-level protocols
reject such insecure headers.

This header field appears once instead of being incorporated into the
signatures' parameters because the signed header fields need to be consistent
across all signatures of an exchange, to avoid forcing higher-level protocols to
merge the header field lists of valid signatures.

See {{how-much-to-sign}} for a discussion of why only the URL from the request
is included and not other request headers.

`Signed-Headers` is a Structured Header as defined by
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be a list (Section 4.8 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) of lowercase strings (Section 4.2 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}) naming HTTP response header fields.
Pseudo-header field names (Section 8.1.2.1 of {{!RFC7540}}) MUST NOT appear in
this list.

Higher-level protocols SHOULD place requirements on the minimum set of headers
to include in the `Signed-Headers` header field.



## HTTP/2 extension for cross-origin Server Push # {#cross-origin-push}

To allow servers to Server-Push (Section 8.2 of {{?RFC7540}}) signed exchanges
({{proposal}}) signed by an authority for which the server is not authoritative
(Section 9.1 of {{?RFC7230}}), this section defines an HTTP/2 extension.

### Indicating support for cross-origin Server Push # {#setting}

Clients that might accept signed Server Pushes with an authority for which the
server is not authoritative indicate this using the HTTP/2 SETTINGS parameter
ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH (0xSETTING-TBD).

An ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH value of 0 indicates that the client does not
support cross-origin Push. A value of 1 indicates that the client does support
cross-origin Push.

A client MUST NOT send a ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH setting with a value other
than 0 or 1 or a value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1. If a server
receives a value that violates these rules, it MUST treat it as a connection
error (Section 5.4.1 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

The use of a SETTINGS parameter to opt-in to an otherwise incompatible protocol
change is a use of "Extending HTTP/2" defined by Section 5.5 of {{?RFC7540}}. If
a server were to send a cross-origin Push without first receiving a
ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH setting with the value of 1 it would be a protocol
violation.

### NO_TRUSTED_EXCHANGE_SIGNATURE error code {#error-code}

The signatures on a Pushed cross-origin exchange may be untrusted for several
reasons, for example that the certificate could not be fetched, that the
certificate does not chain to a trusted root, that the signature itself doesn't
validate, that the signature is expired, etc. This draft conflates all of these
possible failures into one error code, NO_TRUSTED_EXCHANGE_SIGNATURE
(0xERROR-TBD).

#### Open Questions ### {#oq-error-code}

How fine-grained should this specification's error codes be?

### Validating a cross-origin Push ## {#validating-cross-origin-push}

If the client has set the ENABLE_CROSS_ORIGIN_PUSH setting to 1, the server MAY
Push a signed exchange for which it is not authoritative, and the client MUST
NOT treat a PUSH_PROMISE for which the server is not authoritative as a stream
error (Section 5.4.2 of {{!RFC7540}}) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR, as described in
Section 8.2 of {{?RFC7540}}.

Instead, the client MUST validate such a PUSH_PROMISE and its response by taking
the `Signature` header field from the response, and the exchange consisting of
the PUSH_PROMISE and the response without that `Signature` header field, and
passing them to the algorithm in {{cross-origin-trust}}. If this returns
"invalid", the client MUST treat the response as a stream error (Section 5.4.2
of {{!RFC7540}}) of type NO_TRUSTED_EXCHANGE_SIGNATURE. Otherwise, the client
MUST treat the pushed response as if the server were authoritative for the
PUSH_PROMISE's authority.

#### Open Questions ### {#oq-cross-origin-push}

Is it right that "validityUrl" is required to be same-origin with the exchange?
This allows the mitigation against downgrades in {{seccons-downgrades}}, but
prohibits intermediates from providing a cache of the validity information. We
could do both with a list of URLs.

## application/http-exchange+cbor format for HTTP/1 compatibility # {#application-http-exchange}

To allow servers to serve cross-origin responses when either the client or the
server hasn't implemented HTTP/2 Push (Section 8.2 of {{?RFC7540}}) support yet,
we define a format that represents an HTTP exchange.

The `application/http-exchange+cbor` content type encodes an HTTP exchange,
including request metadata and header fields, optionally a request body,
response header fields and metadata, a payload body, and optionally trailer
header fields.

This content type consists of a canonically-serialized ({{canonical-cbor}}) CBOR
array containing:

1. The text string "htxg" to serve as a file signature, followed by
1. Alternating member names encoded as text strings (Section 2.1 of
   {{!RFC7049}}) and member values, with each value consisting of a single CBOR
   item with a type and meaning determined by the member name.

This specification defines the following member names with their associated
values:

"request"

: A map from request header field names to values, encoded as byte strings
  ({{!RFC7049}}, section 2.1). The request header fields MUST include two
  pseudo-header fields (Section 8.1.2.1 of {{!RFC7540}}):

  * `':method'`: The method of the request (Section 4 of {{!RFC7231}}).
  * `':url'`: The effective request URI of the request (Section 5.5 of
    {{!RFC7230}}).

"request payload"

: A byte string ({{!RFC7049}}, section 2.1) containing the request payload body
  (Section 3.3 of {{!RFC7230}}).

"response"

: A map from response header field names to values, encoded as byte strings
  ({{!RFC7049}}, section 2.1). The response header fields MUST include one
  pseudo-header field (Section 8.1.2.1 of {{!RFC7540}}):

  * `':status'`: The response's 3-digit status code (Section 6 of
    {{!RFC7231}}]).

"payload"

: A byte string ({{!RFC7049}}, section 2.1) containing the response payload body
  (Section 3.3 of {{!RFC7230}}).

"trailer"

: A map of trailer header field names to values, encoded as byte strings
  (Section 2.1 of {{!RFC7049}}).

A parser MAY return incremental information while parsing
`application/http-exchange+cbor` content.

Members "request", "response", and "payload" MUST be present. If one is missing,
the parser MUST stop and report an error.

The member names MUST appear in the order:

1. "request"
1. "request payload"
1. "response"
1. "payload"
1. "trailer"

If a member name is not a text string, appears out of order, or is followed by a
value not matching its description above, the parser MUST stop and report an
error.

If the parser encounters an unknown member name, it MUST skip the following item
and resume parsing at the next member name.

### Example ## {#example-application-http-exchange}

An example `application/http-exchange+cbor` file representing a possible
exchange with <https://example.com/> follows, in the extended diagnostic format
defined in Appendix G of {{?I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}:

~~~cbor-diag
[
  "htxg",
  "request",
  {
    ':method': 'GET',
    ':url': 'https://example.com/',
    'accept', '*/*'
  },
  "response",
  {
    ':status': '200',
    'content-type': 'text/html'
  },
  "payload",
  '<!doctype html>\r\n<html>...'
]
~~~

### Open Questions ## {#oq-application-http-exchange}

Should `application/http-exchange+cbor` support request payloads and trailers,
or only the aspects needed for signed exchanges?

Are the mime type, extension, and magic number right?

# Security considerations

## Over-signing ## {#seccons-over-signing}

If a publisher blindly signs all responses as their origin, they can cause at
least two kinds of problems, described below. To avoid this, publishers SHOULD
design their systems to opt particular public content that doesn't depend on
authentication status into signatures instead of signing by default.

Signing systems SHOULD also incorporate the following mitigations to reduce the
risk that private responses are signed:

1. Strip the `Cookie` request header field and other identifying information
   like client authentication and TLS session IDs from requests whose exchange
   is destined to be signed, before forwarding the request to a backend.
1. Only sign exchanges where the response includes a `Cache-Control: public`
   header. Clients are not required to fail signature-checking for exchanges
   that omit this `Cache-Control` response header field to reduce the risk that
   naïve signing systems blindly add it.

### Session fixation ### {#seccons-session-fixation}

Blind signing can sign responses that create session cookies or otherwise change
state on the client to identify a particular session. This breaks certain kinds
of CSRF defense and can allow an attacker to force a user into the attacker's
account, where the user might unintentionally save private information, like
credit card numbers or addresses.

This specification defends against cookie-based attacks by blocking the
`Set-Cookie` response header, but it cannot prevent Javascript or other response
content from changing state.

### Misleading content ### {#seccons-misleading-content}

If a site signs private information, an attacker might set up their own account
to show particular private information, forward that signed information to a
victim, and use that victim's confusion in a more sophisticated attack.

Stripping authentication information from requests before sending them to
backends is likely to prevent the backend from showing attacker-specific
information in the signed response. It does not prevent the attacker from
showing their victim a signed-out page when the victim is actually signed in,
but while this is still misleading, it seems less likely to be useful to the
attacker.

## Off-path attackers ## {#seccons-off-path}

Relaxing the requirement to consult DNS when determining authority for an origin
means that an attacker who possesses a valid certificate no longer needs to be
on-path to redirect traffic to them; instead of modifying DNS, they need only
convince the user to visit another Web site in order to serve responses signed
as the target. This consideration and mitigations for it are shared by the
combination of {{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-origin-frame}} and
{{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2-secondary-certs}}.

## Downgrades ## {#seccons-downgrades}

Signing a bad response can affect more users than simply serving a bad response,
since a served response will only affect users who make a request while the bad
version is live, while an attacker can forward a signed response until its
signature expires. Authors should consider shorter signature expiration times
than they use for cache expiration times.

Clients MAY also check the ["validityUrl"](#signature-validityurl) of an
exchange more often than the signature's expiration would require. Doing so for
an exchange with an HTTPS request URI provides a TLS guarantee that the exchange
isn't out of date (as long as {{oq-cross-origin-push}} is resolved to keep the
same-origin requirement).

## Signing oracles are permanent ## {#seccons-signing-oracles}

An attacker with temporary access to a signing oracle can sign "still valid"
assertions with arbitrary timestamps and expiration times. As a result, when a
signing oracle is removed, the keys it provided access to MUST be revoked so
that, even if the attacker used them to sign future-dated exchange validity
assertions, the key's OCSP assertion will expire, causing the exchange as a
whole to become untrusted.

## Unsigned headers ## {#seccons-unsigned-headers}

The use of a single `Signed-Headers` header field prevents us from signing
aspects of the request other than its effective request URI (Section 5.5 of
{{?RFC7230}}). For example, if an author signs both `Content-Encoding: br` and
`Content-Encoding: gzip` variants of a response, what's the impact if an
attacker serves the brotli one for a request with `Accept-Encoding: gzip`?

The simple form of `Signed-Headers` also prevents us from signing less than the
full request URL. The SRI use case ({{uc-sri}}) may benefit from being able to
leave the authority less constrained.

{{signature-validity}} can succeed when some delivered headers aren't included
in the signed set. This accommodates current TLS-terminating intermediates and
may be useful for SRI ({{uc-sri}}), but is risky for trusting cross-origin
responses ({{uc-pushed-subresources}}, {{uc-explicit-distributor}}, and
{{uc-offline-websites}}). {{cross-origin-push}} requires all headers to be
included in the signature before trusting cross-origin pushed resources, at Ryan
Sleevi's recommendation.

## application/http-exchange+cbor ## {#security-application-http-exchange}

Clients MUST NOT trust an effective request URI claimed by an
`application/http-exchange+cbor` resource ({{application-http-exchange}})
without either ensuring the resource was transferred from a server that was
authoritative (Section 9.1 of {{!RFC7230}}) for that URI's origin, or passing
the `Signature` response header field from the exchange stored in the resource,
and that exchange without its `Signature` response header field, to the
procedure in {{cross-origin-trust}}, and getting "valid" back.

# Privacy considerations

Normally, when a client fetches `https://o1.com/resource.js`,
`o1.com` learns that the client is interested in the resource. If
`o1.com` signs `resource.js`, `o2.com` serves it as
`https://o2.com/o1resource.js`, and the client fetches it from there,
then `o2.com` learns that the client is interested, and if the client
executes the Javascript, that could also report the client's interest back to
`o1.com`.

Often, `o2.com` already knew about the client's interest, because it's the
entity that directed the client to `o1resource.js`, but there may be cases where
this leaks extra information.

For non-executable resource types, a signed response can improve the privacy
situation by hiding the client's interest from the original author.

To prevent network operators other than `o1.com` or `o2.com` from learning which
exchanges were read, clients SHOULD only load exchanges fetched over a transport
that's protected from eavesdroppers. This can be difficult to determine when the
exchange is being loaded from local disk, but when the client itself requested
the exchange over a network it SHOULD require TLS ({{!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}) or a
successor transport layer, and MUST NOT accept exchanges transferred over plain
HTTP without TLS.

# Use cases

## PUSHed subresources {#uc-pushed-subresources}

To reduce round trips, a server might use HTTP/2 Push (Section 8.2 of
{{?RFC7540}}) to inject a subresource from another server into the client's
cache. If anything about the subresource is expired or can't be verified, the
client would fetch it from the original server.

For example, if `https://example.com/index.html` includes

~~~html
<script src="https://jquery.com/jquery-1.2.3.min.js">
~~~

Then to avoid the need to look up and connect to `jquery.com` in the critical
path, `example.com` might push that resource signed by `jquery.com`.

## Explicit use of a content distributor for subresources {#uc-explicit-distributor}

In order to speed up loading but still maintain control over its content, an
HTML page in a particular origin `O.com` could tell clients to load its
subresources from an intermediate content distributor that's not authoritative,
but require that those resources be signed by `O.com` so that the distributor
couldn't modify the resources. This is more constrained than the common CDN case
where `O.com` has a CNAME granting the CDN the right to serve arbitrary content
as `O.com`.

~~~html
<img logicalsrc="https://O.com/img.png"
     physicalsrc="https://distributor.com/O.com/img.png">
~~~

To make it easier to configure the right distributor for a given request,
computation of the `physicalsrc` could be encapsulated in a custom element:

~~~html
<dist-img src="https://O.com/img.png"></dist-img>
~~~

where the `<dist-img>` implementation generates an appropriate `<img>` based on,
for example, a `<meta name="dist-base">` tag elsewhere in the page. However,
this has the downside that the
[preloader](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/big-bad-preloader/) can no
longer see the physical source to download it. The resulting delay might cancel
out the benefit of using a distributor.

This could be used for some of the same purposes as SRI ({{uc-sri}}).

To implement this with the current proposal, the distributor would respond to
the physical request to `https://distributor.com/O.com/img.png` with first a
signed PUSH_PROMISE for `https://O.com/img.png` and then a redirect to
`https://O.com/img.png`.

## Subresource Integrity {#uc-sri}

The W3C WebAppSec group is investigating
[using signatures](https://github.com/mikewest/signature-based-sri) in {{SRI}}.
They need a way to transmit the signature with the response, which this proposal
provides.

Their needs are simpler than most other use cases in that the
`integrity="ed25519-[public-key]"` attribute and CSP-based ways of expressing a
public key don't need that key to be wrapped into a certificate.

The "ed25519Key" signature parameter supports this simpler way of attaching a
key.

The current proposal for signature-based SRI describes signing only the content
of a resource, while this specification requires them to sign the request URI as
well. This issue is tracked in
<https://github.com/mikewest/signature-based-sri/issues/5>. The details of what
they need to sign will affect whether and how they can use this proposal.

## Binary Transparency {#uc-transparency}

So-called "Binary Transparency" may eventually allow users to verify that a
program they've been delivered is one that's available to the public, and not a
specially-built version intended to attack just them. Binary transparency
systems don't exist yet, but they're likely to work similarly to the successful
Certificate Transparency logs described by {{?RFC6962}}.

Certificate Transparency depends on Signed Certificate Timestamps that prove a
log contained a particular certificate at a particular time. To build the same
thing for Binary Transparency logs containing HTTP resources or full websites,
we'll need a way to provide signatures of those resources, which signed
exchanges provides.

## Static Analysis {#uc-static-analysis}

Native app stores like the [Apple App
Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) and the [Android Play
Store](https://play.google.com/store) grant their contents powerful abilities,
which they attempt to make safe by analyzing the applications before offering
them to people. The web has no equivalent way for people to wait to run an
update of a web application until a trusted authority has vouched for it.

While full application analysis probably needs to wait until the authority can
sign bundles of exchanges, authorities may be able to guarantee certain
properties by just checking a top-level resource and its {{SRI}}-constrained
sub-resources.

## Offline websites {#uc-offline-websites}

Fully-offline websites can be represented as bundles of signed exchanges,
although an optimization to reduce the number of signature verifications may be
needed. Work on this is in progress in the <https://github.com/WICG/webpackage>
repository.

# Requirements

## Proof of origin

To verify that a thing came from a particular origin, for use in the same
context as a TLS connection, we need someone to vouch for the signing key with
as much verification as the signing keys used in TLS. The obvious way to do this
is to re-use the web PKI and CA ecosystem.

### Certificate constraints

If we re-use existing TLS server certificates, we incur the risks that:

1. TLS server certificates must be accessible from online servers, so they're
   easier to steal or use as signing oracles than an offline key. An exchange's
   signing key doesn't need to be online.
2. A server using an origin-trusted key for one purpose (e.g. TLS) might
   accidentally sign something that looks like an exchange, or vice versa.

These risks are considered too high, so we define a new X.509 certificate
extension in {{cross-origin-cert-req}} that requires CAs to issue new
certificates for this purpose. We expect at least one low-cost CA to be willing
to sign certificates with this extension.

### Signature constraints

In order to prevent an attacker who can convince the server to sign some
resource from causing those signed bytes to be interpreted as something else the
new X.509 extension here is forbidden from being used in TLS servers. If
{{cross-origin-cert-req}} changes to allow re-use in TLS servers, we would need
to:

1. Avoid key types that are used for non-TLS protocols whose output could be
   confused with a signature. That may be just the `rsaEncryption` OID from
   {{?RFC8017}}.
2. Use the same format as TLS's signatures, specified in Section 4.4.3 of
   {{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}, with a context string that's specific to this use.

The specification also needs to define which signing algorithm to use. It
currently specifies that as a function from the key type, instead of allowing
attacker-controlled data to specify it.

### Retrieving the certificate {#certificate-chain}

The client needs to be able to find the certificate vouching for the signing
key, a chain from that certificate to a trusted root, and possibly other trust
information like SCTs ({{?RFC6962}}). One approach would be to include the
certificate and its chain in the signature metadata itself, but this wastes
bytes when the same certificate is used for multiple HTTP responses. If we
decide to put the signature in an HTTP header, certificates are also unusually
large for that context.

Another option is to pass a URL that the client can fetch to retrieve the
certificate and chain. To avoid extra round trips in fetching that URL, it could
be [bundled](#uc-offline-websites) with the signed content or
[PUSHed](#uc-pushed-subresources) with it. The risks from the
`client_certificate_url` extension (Section 11.3 of {{RFC6066}}) don't seem to
apply here, since an attacker who can get a client to load an exchange and fetch
the certificates it references, can also get the client to perform those fetches
by loading other HTML.

To avoid using an unintended certificate with the same public key as the
intended one, the content of the leaf certificate or the chain should be
included in the signed data, like TLS does (Section 4.4.3 of
{{?I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}).

## How much to sign ## {#how-much-to-sign}

The previous {{?I-D.thomson-http-content-signature}} and
{{?I-D.burke-content-signature}} schemes signed just the content, while
({{?I-D.cavage-http-signatures}} could also sign the response headers and the
request method and path. However, the same path, response headers, and content
may mean something very different when retrieved from a different server.
{{significant-headers}} currently includes the whole request URL in the
signature, but it's possible we need a more flexible scheme to allow some
higher-level protocols to accept a less-signed URL.

The question of whether to include other request headers---primarily the
`accept*` family---is still open. These headers need to be represented so that
clients wanting a different language, say, can avoid using the wrong-language
response, but it's not obvious that there's a security vulnerability if an
attacker can spoof them. For now, the proposal ({{proposal}}) omits other
request headers.

In order to allow multiple clients to consume the same signed exchange, the
exchange shouldn't include the exact request headers that any particular client
sends. For example, a Japanese resource wouldn't include

~~~http
accept-language: ja-JP, ja;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, zh;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
~~~

Instead, it would probably include just

~~~http
accept-language: ja-JP, ja
~~~

and clients would use the same matching logic as
for [PUSH_PROMISE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.2) frame
headers.

### Conveying the signed headers

HTTP headers are traditionally munged by proxies, making it impossible to
guarantee that the client will see the same sequence of bytes as the author
wrote. In the HTTPS world, we have more end-to-end header integrity, but it's
still likely that there are enough TLS-terminating proxies that the author's
signatures would tend to break before getting to the client.

There's also no way in current HTTP for the response to a client-initiated
request (Section 8.1 of {{RFC7540}}) to convey the request headers it expected
to respond to. A PUSH_PROMISE (Section 8.2 of {{RFC7540}}) does not have this
problem, and it would be possible to introduce a response header to convey the
expected request headers.

Since proxies are unlikely to modify unknown content types, we can wrap the
original exchange into an `application/http-exchange+cbor` format
({{application-http-exchange}}) and include the `Cache-Control: no-transform`
header when sending it.

To reduce the likelihood of accidental modification by proxies, the
`application/http-exchange+cbor` format includes a file signature that doesn't
collide with other known signatures.

To help the PUSHed subresources use case ({{uc-pushed-subresources}}), we might
also want to extend the `PUSH_PROMISE` frame type to include a signature, and
that could tell intermediates not to change the ensuing headers.

## Response lifespan

A normal HTTPS response is authoritative only for one client, for as long as its
cache headers say it should live. A signed exchange can be re-used for many
clients, and if it was generated while a server was compromised, it can continue
compromising clients even if their requests happen after the server recovers.
This signing scheme needs to mitigate that risk.

### Certificate revocation

Certificates are mis-issued and private keys are stolen, and in response clients
need to be able to stop trusting these certificates as promptly as possible.
Online revocation
checks [don't work](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html), so
the industry has moved to pushed revocation lists and stapled OCSP responses
{{?RFC6066}}.

Pushed revocation lists work as-is to block trust in the certificate signing an
exchange, but the signatures need an explicit strategy to staple OCSP responses.
One option is to extend the certificate download ({{certificate-chain}}) to
include the OCSP response too, perhaps in the
[TLS 1.3 CertificateEntry](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-tls13.html#ocsp-and-sct) format.

### Response downgrade attacks {#downgrade}

The signed content in a response might be vulnerable to attacks, such as XSS, or
might simply be discovered to be incorrect after publication. Once the author
fixes those vulnerabilities or mistakes, clients should stop trusting the old
signed content in a reasonable amount of time. Similar to certificate
revocation, I expect the best option to be stapled "this version is still valid"
assertions with short expiration times.

These assertions could be structured as:

1. A signed minimum version number or timestamp for a set of request headers:
   This requires that signed responses need to include a version number or
   timestamp, but allows a server to provide a single signature covering all
   valid versions.
1. A replacement for the whole exchange's signature. This requires the author to
   separately re-sign each valid version and requires each version to include a
   different update URL, but allows intermediates to serve less data. This is
   the approach taken in {{proposal}}.
1. A replacement for the exchange's signature and an update for the embedded
   `expires` and related cache-control HTTP headers {{?RFC7234}}. This naturally
   extends authors' intuitions about cache expiration and the existing cache
   revalidation behavior to signed exchanges. This is sketched and its downsides
   explored in {{validity-with-cache-control}}.

The signature also needs to include instructions to intermediates for how to
fetch updated validity assertions.

# Determining validity using cache control # {#validity-with-cache-control}

This draft could expire signature validity using the normal HTTP cache control
headers ({{?RFC7234}}) instead of embedding an expiration date in the signature
itself. This section specifies how that would work, and describes why I haven't
chosen that option.

The signatures in the `Signature` header field ({{signature-header}}) would no
longer contain "date" or "expires" fields.

The validity-checking algorithm ({{signature-validity}}) would initialize `date`
from the resource's `Date` header field (Section 7.1.1.2 of {{?RFC7231}}) and
initialize `expires` from either the `Expires` header field (Section 5.3 of
{{?RFC7234}}) or the `Cache-Control` header field's `max-age` directive (Section
5.2.2.8 of {{?RFC7234}}) (added to `date`), whichever is present, preferring
`max-age` (or failing) if both are present.

Validity updates ({{updating-validity}}) would include a list of replacement
response header fields. For each header field name in this list, the client
would remove matching header fields from the stored exchange's response header
fields. Then the client would append the replacement header fields to the stored
exchange's response header fields.

## Example of updating cache control

For example, given a stored exchange of:

~~~http
GET https://example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200
Date: Mon, 20 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Content-Type: text/html
Date: Tue, 21 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Expires: Sun, 26 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC

<!doctype html>
<html>
...
~~~

And an update listing the following headers:

~~~http
Expires: Fri, 1 Dec 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC
~~~

The resulting stored exchange would be:

~~~http
GET https://example.com/ HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: text/html
Expires: Fri, 1 Dec 2017 10:00:00 UTC
Date: Sat, 25 Nov 2017 10:00:00 UTC

<!doctype html>
<html>
...
~~~

## Downsides of updating cache control ## {#downsides-of-cache-control}

In an exchange with multiple signatures, using cache control to expire
signatures forces all signatures to initially live for the same period. Worse,
the update from one signature's "validityUrl" might not match the update for
another signature. Clients would need to maintain a current set of headers for
each signature, and then decide which set to use when actually parsing the
resource itself.

This need to store and reconcile multiple sets of headers for a single signed
exchange argues for embedding a signature's lifetime into the signature.

# Change Log

RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS SECTION.

draft-03

* Allow each method of transferring an exchange to define which headers are
  signed, have the cross-origin methods use all headers, and remove the
  `allResponseHeaders` flag.
* Describe footguns around signing private content, and block certain headers to
  make it less likely.
* Define a CBOR structure to hold the certificate chain instead of re-using the
  TLS1.3 message. The TLS 1.3 parser fails on unexpected extensions while this
  format should ignore them, and apparently TLS implementations don't expose
  their message parsers enough to allow passing a message to a certificate
  verifier.
* Require an X.509 extension for the signing certificate.

draft-02

* Signatures identify a header (e.g. Digest or MI) to guard the payload's
  integrity instead of directly signing over the payload.
* The validityUrl is signed.
* Use CBOR maps where appropriate, and define how they're canonicalized.
* Remove the update.url field from signature validity updates, in favor of just
  re-fetching the original request URL.
* Define an HTTP/2 extension to use a setting to enable cross-origin Server
  Push.
* Define an `Accept-Signature` header to negotiate whether to send Signatures
  and which ones.
* Define an `application/http-exchange+cbor` format to fetch signed exchanges
  without HTTP/2 Push.
* 2 new use cases.
