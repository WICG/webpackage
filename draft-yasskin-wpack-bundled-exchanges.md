--- abstract

Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with the
request URLs and content negotiation that produced them, to transmit or store
together. They can include multiple top-level resources with one identified as
the default by a primaryUrl metadata, provide random access to their component
exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.

# Introduction

To satisfy the use cases in {{?I-D.yasskin-wpack-use-cases}}, this document
proposes a new bundling format to group HTTP resources. The format is structured
as an initial table of "sections" within the bundle followed by the content of
those sections.

## Terminology and Conventions {#terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14}

This specification uses the conventions and terminology defined in the Infra
Standard ({{INFRA}}).

# Semantics {#semantics}

A bundle is logically a set of HTTP representations (Section 7 of
{{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}), themselves represented by HTTP response
messages (Section 2.1 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}). The bundle can
include an optional URL identifying the primary resource within the bundle and
can include other optional metadata. Particular applications can require that
the primary URL and/or other metadata is present.

While the order of the representations is not semantically meaningful, it can
significantly affect performance when the bundle is loaded from a network
stream.

## Operations {#semantics-operations}

Bundle parsers support two primary operations:

1. They can load the bundle's metadata given a prefix of the bundle.
1. They can find a representation within the bundle given that representation's
   URL ({{semantics-naming}}) and the content-negotiation information that would
   appear in an HTTP request's headers.

## Naming a representation {#semantics-naming}

Representations within a bundle are named by their `Content-Location` (Section
7.8 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}), which holds a URL. This is also known
as the representation's URL.

Multiple representations within a bundle can have the same URL, in which case
they are distinguished by the content negotiation information contained in their
`Variants` and `Variant-Key` headers ({{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}).

This identifying information for each representation is stored in an index
({{index-section}}) rather than in that representation's HTTP response message.

# Expected performance {#performance}

Bundles can be used in two different situations: they can be loaded from storage
that provides O(1) access to any byte within the bundle, or they can be sent
across a stream that provides bytes incrementally. An implementation MAY prefer
either or both situations and SHOULD provide the following performance
characteristics in its preferred situations:

## Random access {#performance-random}

To load a resource when seeing a bundle for the first time, the implementation
reads O(size of the metadata and resource index) before starting to return bytes
of the resource.

TODO: Is big-O notation the right way to express expectations here?

## Streaming {#performance-streaming}

When sending a bundle over a stream, the implementation will need to wait until
it has the sizes of all contained resources before starting to send the resource
index.

When reading a bundle from a stream, the implementation starts returning bytes
of a resource after receiving O(1) bytes of that resource, which comes after
the O(# of resources) bytes of the index.

# Format {#format}

## Top-level structure {#top-level}

A bundle is a CBOR array ({{CBORbis}}) with the following CDDL ({{CDDL}})
schema:

~~~~~ cddl
webbundle = [
  magic: h'F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6',
  version: bytes .size 4,
  primary-url: whatwg-url,
  section-lengths: bytes .cbor section-lengths,
  sections: [* any ],
  length: bytes .size 8,  ; Big-endian number of bytes in the bundle.
]

whatwg-url = tstr
~~~~~

When serialized, the bundle MUST satisfy the core deterministic encoding
requirements from Section 4.2.1 of {{CBORbis}}. This format does not use
floating point values or tags, so this specification does not add any
deterministic encoding rules for them. If an item doesn't follow these
requirements, or a byte-sequence being decoded as a CBOR item contains extra
bytes, the parser MUST signal an error instead of any data it can extract from
that item.

High-level fields in the bundle format are designed to provide their
length-in-bytes before the field starts so that a recipient trying to stream a
bundle from the network can always wait for a known number of bytes instead of
needing to implement a streaming CBOR parser.

The `magic` number is <u format="lit-num">üåêüì¶</u> encoded in UTF-8. With the
CBOR initial bytes for the array and bytestring, this makes the format
identifiable by looking for `8? 48` (in base 16) followed by that UTF-8
encoding. Parsers MUST only check the initial nibble of the initial `8?` byte in
order to accommodate any future version's change in the number of array
elements (up to 15).

The `version` bytestring MUST be `31 00 00 00` in base 16 (an ASCII "1" followed
by 3 0s) for this version of bundles. If the recipient doesn't support the
version in this field, it MUST either ignore the bundle or fetch and use the
content of the `primary-url` field instead.

The `primary-url` field identifies both a fallback when the recipient doesn't
understand the bundle and a default resource inside the bundle to use when the
recipient doesn't have more specific instructions. This field MAY be an empty
string, although protocols using bundles MAY themselves forbid that empty value.

The `section-lengths` and `sections` arrays contain the actual content of the
bundle and are defined in {{sections}}. The `section-lengths` array is embedded
in a byte string to facilitate reading it from a network. This byte string MUST
be less than 8192 (8*1024) bytes long, and parsers MUST not load any data from a
`section-lengths` item longer than this.

The bundle ends with an 8-byte integer holding the length of the whole bundle.

### Trailing length {#from-end}

A bundle ends with an 8-byte CBOR byte string holding a big-endian integer
that represents the byte-length of the whole bundle.

~~~ ascii-art

 +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 | first byte | ... | 48 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | BC | 61 | 4E |
 +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
             /       \
       0xBC614E-10=12345668 omitted bytes
~~~
{: title="Example trailing bytes" anchor="example-trailing-bytes"}

Recipients loading the bundle in a random-access context SHOULD start by reading
the last 8 bytes and seeking backwards by that many bytes to find the start of
the bundle, instead of assuming that the start of the file is also the start of
the bundle. This allows the bundle to be appended to another format such as a
generic self-extracting executable.

### Draft version numbers
{:removeInRFC="true"}

Implementations of drafts of this specification MUST NOT use a `version` string
of `31 00 00 00` (base 16). They MUST instead define an implementation-specific
4-byte string starting with `62` (`b`) to identify which draft is implemented.

## Bundle sections {#sections}

A bundle's content is in a series of sections, which can be accessed randomly
using the information in the `section-lengths` CBOR item:

~~~~~ cddl
section-lengths = [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ],
~~~~~

This field lists the named sections in the bundle in the order they appear, with
each section name followed by the length in bytes of the corresponding CBOR item
in the `sections` array. This allows a random-access parser ({{performance}}) to
jump directly to the section it needs. This specification defines the following
sections:

* `"index"` ({{index-section}})
* `"responses"` ({{responses-section}})

Future specifications can register new section names as described in
{{bundle-section-name-registry}}, in order to extend the format without
incrementing its version number.

The `"responses"` section MUST appear after the other three sections defined
here, and parsers MUST not load any data if that is not the case.

The `sections` array contains the sections' content. The length of this array
MUST be exactly half the length of the `section-lengths` array, and parsers MUST
NOT load any data if that is not the case.

The bundle MUST contain the `"index"` and `"responses"` sections. All other
sections are optional.

### The index section {#index-section}

~~~ cddl
index = {* whatwg-url => [ variants-value, +location-in-responses ] }
variants-value = bstr
location-in-responses = (offset: uint, length: uint)
~~~

The `"index"` section defines the set of HTTP representations in the bundle and
identifies their locations in the `"responses"` section. It consists of a CBOR
map whose keys are the URLs of the representations in the bundle
({{semantics-naming}}). The value of an index entry is an array whose first item
is a `Variants` header field value ({{I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}) or the empty
string. This is followed by a sequence of offset/length pairs, one for each
representation of this resource. The offset is relative to the start of the
`"responses"` section, with an offset of 0 referring to the head of the CBOR
`responses` array itself. The length is the length in bytes of the `response`
CBOR item holding this representation ({{responses-section}}).

If the first item in the value of an index entry is empty, it MUST be followed
by exactly one offset/length pair. This means there is a single representation
for this resource, with no content negotiation.

Otherwise, the first item MUST be followed by one offset/length pair for each of
the possible combinations of available-values within the `Variants` value (the
first item of the array) in lexicographic (row-major) order.

For example, given a `Variants` value of `accept-encoding=(gzip br),
accept-language=(en fr ja)`, the list of offset/length pairs will correspond to
the `Variant-Key`s:

* (gzip en)
* (gzip fr)
* (gzip ja)
* (br en)
* (br fr)
* (br ja)

The order of variant-axes is important. If the `Variants` value were
`accept-language=(en fr ja), accept-encoding=(gzip br)` instead, the
`location-in-responses` pairs would instead correspond to:

* (en gzip)
* (en br)
* (fr gzip)
* (fr br)
* (ja gzip)
* (ja br)

If the wrong number of offset/length pairs is present in a resource's array, the
entire index MUST fail to parse.

A combination of available-values that is omitted from the bundle MUST be
signaled by setting its offset and length to 0.

## Responses {#responses-section}

~~~~~ cddl
responses = [*response]
response = [headers: bstr .cbor headers, payload: bstr]
headers = {* bstr => bstr}
~~~~~

The "responses" section holds the HTTP responses that represent the HTTP
representations in the bundle. It consists of a CBOR array of responses, each of
which is pointed to by one or more entries in the "index" section
({{index-section}}).

The length of the `headers` byte string in a response MUST be less than 524288
(512*1024) bytes, and recipients MUST fail to load a response with longer
headers.

When receiving a bundle in a stream, the recipient MAY process the headers
before the payload has been received and MAY start processing the beginning of
the payload before the end of the payload has been received.

The keys of the headers map MUST consist of lowercase ASCII as described in
Section 8.1.2 of {{!RFC7540}}. Response pseudo-headers (Section 8.1.2.4 of
{{!RFC7540}} are included in this headers map.

Each response's headers MUST include a `:status` pseudo-header with exactly 3 ASCII decimal digits and MUST NOT include any other pseudo-headers.

If a response's payload is not empty, its headers MUST include a `Content-Type`
header (Section 7.4 of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}). The client MUST
interpret the following payload as this specified media type instead of trying
to sniff a media type from the bytes of the payload, for example by appending an
artificial `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header field ({{FETCH}}) to
downstream protocols.

## Serving constraints {#serving-constraints}

When served over HTTP, a response containing an `application/webbundle`
payload MUST include at least the following response header fields, to reduce
content sniffing vulnerabilities ({{seccons-content-sniffing}}):

* Content-Type: application/webbundle
* X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

# Security Considerations {#security}

## Version skew {#seccons-version-skew}

Bundles currently have no mechanism for ensuring that any signed exchanges they
contain constitute a consistent version of those resources. Even if a website
never has a security vulnerability when resources are fetched at a single time,
an attacker might be able to combine a set of resources pulled from different
versions of the website to build a vulnerable site. While the vulnerable site
could have occurred by chance on a client's machine due to normal HTTP caching,
bundling allows an attacker to guarantee that it happens. Future work in this
specification might allow a bundle to constrain its resources to come from a
consistent version.

## Content sniffing ## {#seccons-content-sniffing}

While modern browsers tend to trust the `Content-Type` header sent with a
resource, especially when accompanied by `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
plugins will sometimes search for executable content buried inside a resource
and execute it in the context of the origin that served the resource, leading to
XSS vulnerabilities. For example, some PDF reader plugins look for `%PDF`
anywhere in the first 1kB and execute the code that follows it.

The `application/webbundle` format defined above includes URLs and request
headers early in the format, which an attacker could use to cause these plugins
to sniff a bad content type.

To avoid vulnerabilities, in addition to the response header requirements in
{{serving-constraints}}, servers are advised to only serve an
`application/webbundle` resource from a domain if it would also be safe for that
domain to serve the bundle's content directly, and to follow at least one of the
following strategies:

1. Only serve bundles from dedicated domains that don't have access to sensitive
   cookies or user storage.
1. Generate bundles "offline", that is, in response to a trusted author
   submitting content or existing signatures reaching a certain age, rather than
   in response to untrusted-reader queries.
1. Do all of:
   1. If the bundle's contained URLs (e.g. in the index) are
      derived from the request for the bundle,
      [percent-encode](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode) ({{URL}})
      any bytes that are greater than 0x7E or are not [URL code
      points](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points) ({{URL}}) in these
      URLs. It is particularly important to make sure no unescaped nulls (0x00)
      or angle brackets (0x3C and 0x3E) appear.
   1. Similarly, if the request headers for any contained resource are based on
      the headers sent while requesting the bundle, only include request header
      field names **and values** that appear in a static allowlist. Keep the set of
      allowed request header fields smaller than 24 elements to prevent
      attackers from controlling a whole CBOR length byte.
   1. Restrict the number of items a request can direct the server to include in
      a bundle to less than 12, again to prevent attackers from controlling a
      whole CBOR length byte.
   1. Do not reflect request header fields into the set of response headers.

If the server serves responses that are written by a potential attacker but then
escaped, the `application/webbundle` format allows the attacker to use the
length of the response to control a few bytes before the start of the response.
Any existing mechanisms that prevent polyglot documents probably keep working in
the face of this new attack, but we don't have a guarantee of that.

To encourage servers to include the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
field, clients SHOULD reject bundles served without it.
