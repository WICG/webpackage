--- abstract

Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with the URLs
and request URLs that produced them, to transmit or store them together. They
can include multiple top-level resources with one identified as the default by a
primaryUrl metadata, provide random access to their component exchanges, and
efficiently store 8-bit resources.

# Introduction

To satisfy the use cases in {{?I-D.yasskin-wpack-use-cases}}, this document
proposes a new bundling format to group HTTP resources. Several of the use cases
require the resources to be signed: that's provided by bundling signed exchanges
({{?I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses}}) rather than natively in this
format.

## Terminology

Exchange (noun)
: An HTTP request+response pair. This can either be a request from a client and
the matching response from a server or the request in a PUSH_PROMISE and its
matching response stream. Defined by Section 8 of {{!RFC7540}}.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Mode of specification {#mode}

This specification defines how conformant bundle parsers work. It does not
constrain how encoders produce a bundle: although there are some guidelines in
{{authoring-guidelines}}, encoders MAY produce any sequence of bytes that a
conformant parser would parse into the intended semantics.

This specification uses the conventions and terminology defined in the Infra
Standard ({{INFRA}}).

# Semantics {#semantics}

A bundle is logically a set of HTTP exchanges, with a URL identifying the
primary resource of the bundle.

While the order of the exchanges is not semantically meaningful, it can
significantly affect performance when the bundle is loaded from a network
stream.

A bundle is parsed from a stream of bytes, which is assumed to have the
attributes and operations described in {{stream-operations}}.

Bundle parsers support two operations,
{{semantics-load-metadata}}{:format="title"} ({{semantics-load-metadata}}) and
{{semantics-load-response}}{:format="title"} ({{semantics-load-response}}) each
of which can return an error instead of their normal result.

A client is expected to load the metadata for a bundle as soon as it starts
downloading it or otherwise discovers it. Then, when fetching ({{FETCH}}) a
request, the client is expected to match it against the requests in the
metadata, and if one matches, load that request's response.

## Stream attributes and operations {#stream-operations}

* A sequence of **available bytes**. As the stream delivers bytes, these are
  appended to the available bytes.
* An **EOF** flag that's true if the available bytes include the entire stream.
* A **current offset** within the available bytes.
* A **seek to offset N** operation to set the current offset to N bytes past the
  beginning of the available bytes. A seek past the end of the available bytes
  blocks until N bytes are available. If the stream ends before enough bytes are
  received, either due to a network error or because the stream has a finite
  length, the seek fails.
* A **read N bytes** operation, which blocks until N bytes are available past
  the current offset, and then returns them and seeks forward by N bytes. If the
  stream ends before enough bytes are received, either due to a network error or
  because the stream has a finite length, the read operation returns an error
  instead.

## Load a bundle's metadata {#semantics-load-metadata}

This takes the bundle's stream and returns either an error (where an error is a
"format error" or a "version error"), an error with a fallback URL (which is
also the primaryUrl when the bundle parses successfully), or a map ({{INFRA}})
of metadata containing at least keys named:

primaryUrl

: The URL of the main resource in the bundle. If the client can't process the
bundle for any reason, this is also the fallback URL, a reasonable URL to try to
load instead.

requests

: A map ({{INFRA}}) whose keys are URLs and whose values consist of either:

  * A single `ResponseMetadata` value for a non-content-negotiated resource or

  * A set of content-negotiated resources represented by
    * A `Variants` header field value ({{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}) and

    * A map ({{INFRA}}) from each of the possible combinations of one
      available-value for each variant-axis to a `ResponseMetadata` structure.
      {{semantics-load-response}}{:format="title"} can use the
      `ResponseMetadata` structures to find the matching response.

The map may include other items added by sections defined in the
{{section-name-registry}}{:format="title"}.

This operation only waits for a prefix of the stream that, if the bundle is
encoded with the "responses" section last, ends before the first response.

This operation's implementation is in {{load-metadata}}.

### Load a bundle's metadata from the end {#semantics-load-metadata-from-end}

If a bundle's bytes are embedded in a longer sequence rather than being
streamed, a parser can also load them starting from a pointer to the last byte
of the bundle. This returns the same data as {{semantics-load-metadata}}.

This operation's implementation is in {{from-end}}.

## Load a response from a bundle {#semantics-load-response}

This takes the stream of bytes representing the bundle, a request ({{FETCH}}),
and the `ResponseMetadata` returned from {{semantics-load-metadata}} for the
appropriate content-negotiated resource within the request's URL, and returns
the response ({{FETCH}}) matching that request.

This operation can be completed without inspecting bytes other than those that
make up the loaded response, although higher-level operations like proving that
an exchange is correctly signed ({{I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses}})
may need to load other responses.

A client will generally want to load the response for a request that the client
generated. For a URL with multiple variants, the client SHOULD use the algorithm
in Section 4 of {{I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}} to select the best variant.

This operation's implementation is in {{load-response}}.

# Format {#format}

## Top-level structure {#top-level}

*This section is non-normative.*

A bundle holds a series of named sections. The beginning of the bundle maps
section names to the range of bytes holding that section. The most important
section is the "index" ({{index-section}}), which similarly maps serialized HTTP
requests to the range of bytes holding that request's serialized response. Byte
ranges are represented using an offset from some point in the bundle *after* the
encoding of the range itself, to reduce the amount of work needed to use the
shortest possible encoding of the range.

Future specifications can define new sections with extra data, and if necessary,
these sections can be marked "critical" ({{critical-section}}) to prevent older
parsers from using the rest of the bundle incorrectly.

The bundle is a CBOR item ({{CBORbis}}) with the following CDDL ({{CDDL}})
schema:

~~~~~ cddl
webbundle = [
  ; üåêüì¶ in UTF-8.
  magic: h'F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6',
  version: bytes .size 4,
  primary-url: whatwg-url,
  section-lengths: bytes .cbor [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ],
  sections: [* any ],
  length: bytes .size 8,  ; Big-endian number of bytes in the bundle.
]

$section-name /= "index" / "manifest" / "signatures" / "critical" / "responses"

$section /= index / manifest / signatures / critical / responses

responses = [*response]

whatwg-url = tstr

~~~~~

## Serving constraints {#serving-constraints}

When served over HTTP, a response containing an `application/webbundle`
payload MUST include at least the following response header fields, to reduce
content sniffing vulnerabilities ({{seccons-content-sniffing}}):

* Content-Type: application/webbundle
* X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

## Load a bundle's metadata {#load-metadata}

A bundle holds a series of sections, which can be accessed randomly using the
information in the `section-lengths` CBOR item, which holds a list of
alternating section names and section lengths:

~~~~~ cddl
section-lengths = [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ],
~~~~~

To implement {{semantics-load-metadata}}, the parser MUST run the following
steps, taking the `stream` as input.

1. Seek to offset 0 in `stream`. Assert: this operation doesn't fail.

1. If reading 10 bytes from `stream` returns an error or doesn't return the
   bytes with hex encoding "86 48 F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6" (the CBOR encoding of
   the 6-item array initial byte and 8-byte bytestring initial byte, followed by
   üåêüì¶ in UTF-8), return a "format error".

1. Let `version` be the result of reading 5 bytes from `stream`. If this is
   an error, return a "format error".

1. Let `urlType` and `urlLength` be the result of reading the type and argument
   of a CBOR item from `stream` ({{parse-type-argument}}). If this is an error
   or `urlType` is not 3 (a CBOR text string), return a "format error".

1. Let `fallbackUrlBytes` be the result of reading `urlLength` bytes from
   `stream`. If this is an error, return a "format error".

1. Let `fallbackUrl` be the result of parsing ({{URL}}) the UTF-8 decoding of
   `fallbackUrlBytes` with no base URL. If either the UTF-8 decoding or parsing
   fails, return a "format error".

   Note: From this point forward, errors also include the fallback URL to help
   clients recover.

1. If `version` does not have the hex encoding "44 31 00 00 00" (the CBOR
   encoding of a 4-byte byte string holding an ASCII "1" followed by three 0
   bytes), return a "version error" with `fallbackUrl`.

   Note: RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS NOTE; Implementations of drafts of this
    specification MUST NOT use the version "1" in this byte string, and MUST
    instead define an implementation-specific string to identify which draft is
    implemented. This string SHOULD match the version used in the draft's MIME
    type ({{internet-media-type-registration}}).

1. Let `sectionLengthsLength` be the result of getting the length of the CBOR
   bytestring header from `stream` ({{parse-bytestring}}). If this is an error,
   return a "format error" with `fallbackUrl`.

1. If `sectionLengthsLength` is 8192 (8*1024) or greater, return  a "format
   error" with `fallbackUrl`.

1. Let `sectionLengthsBytes` be the result of reading `sectionLengthsLength`
   bytes from `stream`. If `sectionLengthsBytes` is an error, return a "format
   error" with `fallbackUrl`.

1. Let `sectionLengths` be the result of parsing one CBOR item ({{parse-cbor}})
   from `sectionLengthsBytes`, matching the section-lengths rule in the CDDL
   ({{CDDL}}) above. If `sectionLengths` is an error, return a "format error"
   with `fallbackUrl`.

1. Let (`sectionsType`, `numSections`) be the result of parsing the type and
   argument of a CBOR item from `stream` ({{parse-type-argument}}).

1. If `sectionsType` is not `4` (a CBOR array) or `numSections` is not half of
   the length of `sectionLengths`, return a "format error" with `fallbackUrl`.

1. Let `sectionsStart` be the current offset within `stream`.

   For example, if `sectionLengthsLength` were 52 and `sectionLengths` contained
   4 items (2 sections), `sectionsStart` would be 65 (10 initial bytes + a
   2-byte bytestring header to describe a 52-byte bytestring + 52 bytes of
   section lengths + a 1-byte array header for the 2 sections).

1. Let `knownSections` be the subset of the {{section-name-registry}} that this
   client has implemented.

1. Let `ignoredSections` be an empty set.

1. Let `sectionOffsets` be an empty map ({{INFRA}}) from section names to
   (offset, length) pairs. These offsets are relative to the start of `stream`.

1. Let `currentOffset` be `sectionsStart`.

1. For each (`"name"`, `length`) pair of adjacent elements in `sectionLengths`:
   1. If `"name"`'s specification in `knownSections` says not to process other
      sections, add those sections' names to `ignoredSections`.

      Note: The `ignoredSections` enables sections that supercede other sections
      to be introduced in the future. Implementations that don't implement any
      such sections are free to omit the relevant steps.
   1. If `sectionOffsets["name"]` exists, return a "format error" with
      `fallbackUrl`. That is, duplicate sections are forbidden.
   1. Set `sectionOffsets["name"]` to (`currentOffset`, `length`).
   1. Set `currentOffset` to `currentOffset + length`.

1. If the "responses" section is not last in `sectionLengths`, return a "format
   error" with `fallbackUrl`. This allows a streaming parser to assume that
   it'll know the requests by the time their responses arrive.

1. Let `metadata` be a map ({{INFRA}}) initially containing the single key/value
   pair `"primaryUrl"`/`fallbackUrl`.

1. For each `"name"` ‚Üí (`offset`, `length`) triple in `sectionOffsets`:
   1. If `"name"` isn't in `knownSections`, continue to the next triple.
   1. If `"name"`'s Metadata field ({{section-name-registry}}) is "No", continue
      to the next triple.
   1. If `"name"` is in `ignoredSections`, continue to the next triple.
   1. Seek to offset `offset` in `stream`. If this fails, return a "format
      error" with `fallbackUrl`.
   1. Let `sectionContents` be the result of reading `length` bytes from
      `stream`. If `sectionContents` is an error, return a "format error" with
      `fallbackUrl`.
   1. Follow `"name"`'s specification from `knownSections` to process the
      section, passing `sectionContents`, `stream`, `sectionOffsets`, and
      `metadata`. If this returns an error, return a "format error" with
      `fallbackUrl`.

1. Assert: `metadata` has an entry with the key "primaryUrl".

1. If `metadata` doesn't have an entry with key "requests", return a
   "format error" with `fallbackUrl`.

1. Return `metadata`.

### Parsing the index section {#index-section}

The "index" section defines the set of HTTP requests in the bundle and
identifies their locations in the "responses" section. It consists of a map from
URL strings to arrays consisting of a `Variants` header field value
({{I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}) followed by one `location-in-responses` pair for
each of the possible combinations of available-values within the `Variants`
value in lexicographic (row-major) order.

For example, given a `variants-value` of `Accept-Encoding;gzip;br,
Accept-Language;en;fr;ja`, the list of `location-in-responses` pairs will
correspond to the `VariantKey`s:

* gzip;en
* gzip;fr
* gzip;ja
* br;en
* br;fr
* br;ja

The order of variant-axes is important. If the `variants-value` were
`Accept-Language;en;fr;ja, Accept-Encoding;gzip;br` instead, the
`location-in-responses` pairs would instead correspond to:

* en;gzip
* en;br
* fr;gzip
* fr;br
* ja;gzip
* ja;br

As a special case, an empty `variants-value` indicates that there is only one
resource at the specified URL and that no content negotiation is performed.

~~~ cddl
index = {* whatwg-url => [ variants-value, +location-in-responses ] }
variants-value = bstr
location-in-responses = (offset: uint, length: uint)
~~~

A `ResponseMetadata` struct identifies a byte range within the bundle stream,
defined by an integer offset from the start of the stream and the integer number
of bytes in the range.

To parse the index section, given its `sectionContents`, the `sectionOffsets`
map, and the `metadata` map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `index` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the `index` rule in the above CDDL ({{parse-cbor}}). If `index` is
   an error, return an error.

1. Let `requests` be an initially-empty map ({{INFRA}}) from URLs to response
   descriptions, each of which is either a single `location-in-stream` value or a
   pair of a `Variants` header field value ({{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}) and
   a map from that value's possible `Variant-Key`s to `location-in-stream`
   values, as described in {{semantics-load-metadata}}.

1. Let `MakeRelativeToStream` be a function that takes a `location-in-responses`
   value (`offset`, `length`) and returns a `ResponseMetadata` struct or error
   by running the following sub-steps:
   1. If `offset` + `length` is larger than
      `sectionOffsets["responses"].length`, return an error.
   1. Otherwise, return a `ResponseMetadata` struct whose offset is
      `sectionOffsets["responses"].offset` + `offset` and whose length is
      `length`.

1. For each (`url`, `responses`) entry in the `index` map:
   1. Let `parsedUrl` be the result of parsing ({{URL}}) `url` with
      no base URL.
   1. If `parsedUrl` is a failure, its fragment is not null, or it includes
      credentials, return an error.
   1. If the first element of `responses` is the empty string:
      1. If the length of `responses` is not 3 (i.e. there is more than one
         `location-in-responses` in responses), return an error.
      1. Otherwise, assert that `requests`\[`parsedUrl`] does not exist, and set
         `requests`\[`parsedUrl`] to
         `MakeRelativeToStream(location-in-responses)`, where
         `location-in-responses` is the second and third elements of
         `responses`. If that returns an error, return an error.
   1. Otherwise:
      1. Let `variants` be the result of parsing the first element of
         `responses` as the value of the `Variants` HTTP header field (Section 2
         of {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}). If this fails, return an error.
      1. Let `variantKeys` be the Cartesian product of the lists of
         available-values for each variant-axis in lexicographic (row-major)
         order. See the examples above.
      1. If the length of `responses` is not `2 * len(variantKeys) + 1`, return
         an error.
      1. Set `requests`\[`parsedUrl`] to a map from `variantKeys`\[`i`] to the
         result of calling `MakeRelativeToStream` on the `location-in-responses`
         at `responses`\[`2*i+1`] and `responses`\[`2*i+2`], for `i` in \[`0`,
         `len(variantKeys)`). If any `MakeRelativeToStream` call returns an
         error, return an error.

1. Set `metadata["requests"]` to `requests`.

### Parsing the manifest section {#manifest-section}

The "manifest" section records a single URL identifying the manifest of the
bundle. The URL MUST refer to the one or more response(s) contained in the
bundle itself.

The bundle can contain multiple resources at this URL, and the client is
expected to content-negotiate for the best one. For example, a client might
select the one with an `accept` header of `application/manifest+json`
({{appmanifest}}) and an `accept-language` header of `es-419`.

~~~ cddl
manifest = whatwg-url
~~~

To parse the manifest section, given its `sectionContents` and the `metadata`
map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `urlString` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the above `manifest` rule ({{parse-cbor}}. If `urlString` is an
   error, return that error.

1. Let `url` be the result of parsing ({{URL}}) `urlString` with no base URL.

1. If `url` is a failure, its fragment is not null, or it includes credentials,
   return an error.

1. Set `metadata["manifest"]` to `url`.

### Parsing the signatures section {#signatures-section}

The "signatures" section vouches for the resources in the bundle.

The section can contain as many signatures as needed, each by some authority,
and each covering an arbitrary subset of the resources in the bundle.
Intermediates, including attackers, can remove signatures from the bundle
without breaking the other signatures.

The bundle parser's client is responsible to determine the validity and meaning
of each authority's signatures. In particular, the algorithm below does not
check that signatures are valid. For example, a client might:

* Use the ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256 algorithm defined in Section 4.2.3 of
  {{TLS1.3}} to check the validity of any signature with an EC public key on the
  secp256r1 curve.
* Reject all signatures by an RSA public key.
* Treat an X.509 certificate with the CanSignHttpExchanges extension (Section
  4.2 of {{?I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses}}) and a valid chain to a
  trusted root as an authority that vouches for the authenticity of resources
  claimed to come from that certificate's domains.
* Treat an X.509 certificate with another extension or EKU as vouching that a
  particular analysis has run over the signed resources without finding
  malicious behavior.

A client might also choose different behavior for those kinds of authorities and
keys.

~~~ cddl
signatures = [
  authorities: [*authority],
  vouched-subsets: [*{
    authority: index-in-authorities,
    sig: bstr,
    signed: bstr  ; Expected to hold a signed-subset item.
  }],
]
authority = augmented-certificate
index-in-authorities = uint

signed-subset = {
  validity-url: whatwg-url,
  auth-sha256: bstr,
  date: uint,
  expires: uint,
  subset-hashes: {+
    whatwg-url => [variants-value, +resource-integrity]
  },
  * tstr => any,
}
resource-integrity = (header-sha256: bstr, payload-integrity-header: tstr)
~~~

The `augmented-certificate` CDDL rule comes from Section 3.3 of {{!I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses}}.

To parse the signatures section, given its `sectionContents`, the `sectionOffsets`
map, and the `metadata` map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `signatures` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the `signatures` rule in the above CDDL ({{parse-cbor}}).
1. Set `metadata["authorities"]` to the list of authorities in the first element
   of the `signatures` array.
1. Set `metadata["vouched-subsets"]` to the second element of the `signatures`
   array.

### Parsing the critical section {#critical-section}

The "critical" section lists sections of the bundle that the client needs to
understand in order to load the bundle correctly. Other sections are assumed to
be optional.

~~~ cddl
critical = [*tstr]
~~~

To parse the critical section, given its `sectionContents` and the `metadata`
map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `critical` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the above `critical` rule ({{parse-cbor}}). If `critical` is an
   error, return that error.
1. For each value `sectionName` in the `critical` list, if the client has not
   implemented sections named `sectionName`, return an error.

This section does not modify the returned metadata.

### The responses section {#responses-section}

The responses section does not add any items to the bundle metadata map.
Instead, its offset and length are used in processing the index section
({{index-section}}).

### Starting from the end {#from-end}

The length of a bundle is encoded as a big-endian integer inside a CBOR byte
string at the end of the bundle.

~~~ ascii-art

 +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 | first byte | ... | 48 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | BC | 61 | 4E |
 +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
             /       \
       0xBC614E-10=12345668 omitted bytes
~~~
{: title="Example trailing bytes" anchor="example-trailing-bytes"}

Parsing from the end allows the bundle to be appended to another format such as
a self-extracting executable.

To implement {{semantics-load-metadata-from-end}}, taking a sequence of bytes
`bytes`, the client MUST:

1. Let `byteStringHeader` be `bytes[bytes.length - 9]`. If `byteStringHeader is
   not `0x48` (the CBOR ({{CBORbis}}) initial byte for an 8-byte byte string),
   return an error.
1. Let `bundleLength` be `[bytes[bytes.length - 8], bytes[bytes.length])` (the
   last 8 bytes) interpreted as a big-endian integer.
1. If `bundleLength > bytes.length`, return an error.
1. Let `stream` be a new stream whose:
   * Available bytes are `[bytes[bytes.length - bundleLength],
     bytes[bytes.length])`.
   * EOF flag is set.
   * Current offset is initially 0.
   * The seek to offset N and read N bytes operations succeed immediately if
     `currentOffset + N <= bundleLength` and fail otherwise.
1. Return the result of running {{load-metadata}} with `stream` as input.

## Load a response from a bundle {#load-response}

The result of {{load-metadata}}{:format="title"} maps each URL and Variant-Key
({{?I-D.ietf-httpbis-variants}}) to a
response, which consists of headers and a payload. The headers can be loaded
from the bundle's stream before waiting for the payload, and similarly the
payload can be streamed to downstream consumers.

~~~~~ cddl
response = [headers: bstr .cbor headers, payload: bstr]
~~~~~

To implement {{semantics-load-response}}, the parser MUST run the following
steps, taking the bundle's `stream`, a `request` ({{FETCH}}), and a
`responseMetadata` returned by {{semantics-load-metadata}} .

1. Seek to offset `responseMetadata.offset` in `stream`. If this fails, return an
   error.
1. Read 1 byte from `stream`. If this is an error or isn't `0x82`, return an
   error.
1. Let `headerLength` be the result of getting the length of a CBOR bytestring
   header from `stream` ({{parse-bytestring}}). If `headerLength` is an error,
   return that error.
1. If `headerLength` is 524288 (512*1024) or greater, return an error.
1. Let `headerCbor` be the result of reading `headerLength` bytes from `stream`
   and parsing a CBOR item from them matching the `headers` CDDL rule. If either
   the read or parse returns an error, return that error.
1. Let (`headers`, `pseudos`) be the result of converting `headerCbor` to a
   header list and pseudoheaders using the algorithm in {{cbor-headers}}. If
   this returns an error, return that error.
1. If `pseudos` does not have a key named ':status' or its size isn't 1, return
   an error.
1. If `pseudos[':status']` isn't exactly 3 ASCII decimal digits, return an
   error.

1. Let `payloadLength` be the result of getting the length of a CBOR bytestring
   header from `stream` ({{parse-bytestring}}). If `payloadLength` is an error,
   return that error.

1. If `payloadLength` is greater than 0 and `headers` does not contain a
   `Content-Type` header, return an error.

   The client MUST interpret the following payload as this specified media type
   instead of trying to sniff a media type from the bytes of the payload, for
   example by appending an artificial `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
   field ({{FETCH}}) to `headers`.

1. If `stream.currentOffset + payloadLength != responseMetadata.offset +
   responseMetadata.length`, return an error.

1. Let `body` be a new body ({{FETCH}}) whose stream is a tee'd copy of `stream`
   starting at the current offset and ending after `payloadLength` bytes.

   TODO: Add the rest of the details of creating a `ReadableStream` object.

1. Let `response` be a new response ({{FETCH}}) whose:
   * Url list is `request`'s url list,
   * status is `pseudos[':status']`,
   * header list is `headers`, and
   * body is `body`.

1. Return `response`.

## Parsing CBOR items {#parse-cbor}

Parsing a bundle involves parsing many CBOR items. All of these items need to be
deterministically encoded.

### Parse a known-length item {#parse-known-length}

To parse a CBOR item ({{CBORbis}}), optionally matching a CDDL rule ({{CDDL}}),
from a sequence of bytes, `bytes`, the parser MUST do the following:

1. If `bytes` are not a well-formed CBOR item, return an error.
1. If `bytes` does not satisfy the core deterministic encoding requirements from
   Section 4.2.1 of {{CBORbis}}, return an error. This format does not use
   floating point values or tags, so this specification does not add any
   deterministic encoding rules for them.
1. If `bytes` includes extra bytes after the encoding of a CBOR item, return an
   error.
1. Let `item` be the result of decoding `bytes` as a CBOR item.
1. If a CDDL rule was specified, but `item` does not match it, return an error.
1. Return `item`.

### Parsing variable-length data from a bytestring {#parse-bytestring}

Bundles encode variable-length data in CBOR bytestrings, which are prefixed with
their length. This algorithm returns the number of bytes in the variable-length
item and sets the stream's current offset to  the first byte of the contents.

To get the length of a CBOR bytestring header from a bundle's stream, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let (`type`, `argument`) be the result of parsing the type and argument of a
   CBOR item from the stream ({{parse-type-argument}}). If this returns an
   error, return that error.
1. If `type` is not `2`, the item is not a bytestring. Return an error.
1. Return `argument`.

### Parsing the type and argument of a CBOR item {#parse-type-argument}

To parse the type and argument of a CBOR item from a bundle's stream, the parser
MUST do the following. This algorithm returns a pair of the CBOR major type 0--7
inclusive, and a 64-bit integral argument for the CBOR item:

1. Let `firstByte` be the result of reading 1 byte from the stream. If
   `firstByte` is an error, return that error.
1. Let `type` be `(firstByte & 0xE0) / 0x20`.
1. If `firstByte & 0x1F` is:

   0..23, inclusive
   : Return (`type`, `firstByte & 0x1F`).

   24
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 1 byte from the stream. If `content`
     is an error or is less than 24, return an error.

   25
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 2 bytes from the stream. If
     `content` is an error or its first byte is 0, return an error.

   26
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 4 bytes from the stream. If
     `content` is an error or its first two bytes are 0, return an error.

   27
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 8 bytes from the stream. If
     `content` is an error or its first four bytes are 0, return an error.

   28..31, inclusive
   : Return an error.

     Note: This intentionally does not support indefinite-length items.
1. Let `argument` be the big-endian integer encoded in `content`.
1. Return (`type`, `argument`).

## Interpreting CBOR HTTP headers {#cbor-headers}

Bundles represent HTTP requests and responses as a list of headers, matching the
following CDDL ({{CDDL}}):

~~~ cddl
headers = {* bstr => bstr}
~~~

Pseudo-headers starting with a `:` provide the non-header information needed to
create a request or response as appropriate

To convert a CBOR item `item` into a {{FETCH}} header list and pseudoheaders,
parsers MUST do the following:

1. If `item` doesn't match the `headers` rule in the above CDDL, return an
   error.
1. Let `headers` be a new header list ({{FETCH}}).
1. Let `pseudos` be an empty map ({{INFRA}}).

1. For each pair (`name`, `value`) in `item`:
   1. If `name` contains any upper-case or non-ASCII characters, return an
      error. This matches the requirement in Section 8.1.2 of {{?RFC7540}}.
   1. If `name` starts with a ':':
      1. Assert: `pseudos[name]` does not exist, because CBOR maps cannot
         contain duplicate keys.
      1. Set `pseudos[name]` to `value`.
      1. Continue.
   1. If `name` or `value` doesn't satisfy the requirements for a header in
      {{FETCH}}, return an error.
   1. Assert: `headers` does not contain ({{FETCH}}) `name`, because CBOR maps
      cannot contain duplicate keys and an earlier step rejected upper-case
      bytes.

      Note: This means that a response cannot set more than one cookie, because
      the `Set-Cookie` header ({{?RFC6265}}) has to appear multiple times to set
      multiple cookies.
   1. Append (`name`, `value`) to `headers`.

1. Return (`headers`, `pseudos`).

# Guidelines for bundle authors {#authoring-guidelines}

Bundles SHOULD consist of a single CBOR item satisfying the core deterministic
encoding requirements ({{parse-cbor}}) and matching the `webbundle` CDDL rule in
{{top-level}}.

# Security Considerations {#security}

## Version skew {#seccons-version-skew}

Bundles currently have no mechanism for ensuring that the signed exchanges they
contain constitute a consistent version of those resources. Even if a website
never has a security vulnerability when resources are fetched at a single time,
an attacker might be able to combine a set of resources pulled from different
versions of the website to build a vulnerable site. While the vulnerable site
could have occurred by chance on a client's machine due to normal HTTP caching,
bundling allows an attacker to guarantee that it happens. Future work in this
specification might allow a bundle to constrain its resources to come from a
consistent version.

## Content sniffing ## {#seccons-content-sniffing}

While modern browsers tend to trust the `Content-Type` header sent with a
resource, especially when accompanied by `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
plugins will sometimes search for executable content buried inside a resource
and execute it in the context of the origin that served the resource, leading to
XSS vulnerabilities. For example, some PDF reader plugins look for `%PDF`
anywhere in the first 1kB and execute the code that follows it.

The `application/webbundle` format defined above includes URLs and request
headers early in the format, which an attacker could use to cause these plugins
to sniff a bad content type.

To avoid vulnerabilities, in addition to the response header requirements in
{{serving-constraints}}, servers are advised to only serve an
`application/webbundle` resource from a domain if it would also be safe for that
domain to serve the bundle's content directly, and to follow at least one of the
following strategies:

1. Only serve bundles from dedicated domains that don't have access to sensitive
   cookies or user storage.
1. Generate bundles "offline", that is, in response to a trusted author
   submitting content or existing signatures reaching a certain age, rather than
   in response to untrusted-reader queries.
1. Do all of:
   1. If the bundle's contained URLs (e.g. in the manifest and index) are
      derived from the request for the bundle,
      [percent-encode](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode) ({{URL}})
      any bytes that are greater than 0x7E or are not [URL code
      points](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-code-points) ({{URL}}) in these
      URLs. It is particularly important to make sure no unescaped nulls (0x00)
      or angle brackets (0x3C and 0x3E) appear.
   1. Similarly, if the request headers for any contained resource are based on
      the headers sent while requesting the bundle, only include request header
      field names **and values** that appear in a static allowlist. Keep the set of
      allowed request header fields smaller than 24 elements to prevent
      attackers from controlling a whole CBOR length byte.
   1. Restrict the number of items a request can direct the server to include in
      a bundle to less than 12, again to prevent attackers from controlling a
      whole CBOR length byte.
   1. Do not reflect request header fields into the set of response headers.

If the server serves responses that are written by a potential attacker but then
escaped, the `application/webbundle` format allows the attacker to use the
length of the response to control a few bytes before the start of the response.
Any existing mechanisms that prevent polyglot documents probably keep working in
the face of this new attack, but we don't have a guarantee of that.

To encourage servers to include the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
field, clients SHOULD reject bundles served without it.

# IANA considerations

## Internet Media Type Registration

IANA is requested to register the MIME media type ({{!IANA.media-types}}) for
web bundles, application/webbundle, as follows:

* Type name: application

* Subtype name: webbundle

* Required parameters:

  * v: A string denoting the version of the file format. ({{!RFC5234}} ABNF:
    `version = 1*(DIGIT/%x61-7A)`) The version defined in this specification is `1`.

    Note: RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS NOTE; Implementations of drafts of this
    specification MUST NOT use simple integers to describe their versions, and
    MUST instead define implementation-specific strings to identify which draft
    is implemented.

* Optional parameters: N/A

* Encoding considerations: binary

* Security considerations: See {{security}} of this document.

* Interoperability considerations: N/A

* Published specification: This document

* Applications that use this media type: None yet, but it is expected that web
     browsers will use this format.

* Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

* Additional information:

  * Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
  * Magic number(s): 86 48 F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6
  * File extension(s): .wbn
  * Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

* Person & email address to contact for further information:
  See the Author's Address section of this specification.

* Intended usage: COMMON

* Restrictions on usage: N/A

* Author:
  See the Author's Address section of this specification.

* Change controller:
  The IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

* Provisional registration? Yes.

## Web Bundle Section Name Registry {#section-name-registry}

IANA is directed to create a new registry with the following attributes:

Name: Web Bundle Section Names

Review Process: Specification Required

Initial Assignments:

| Section Name | Specification | Metadata | Metadata Fields |
| "index" | {{index-section}} | Yes | "requests" |
| "manifest" | {{manifest-section}} | Yes | "manifest" |
| "signatures" | {{signatures-section}} | Yes | "authorities", "vouched-subsets" |
| "critical" | {{critical-section}} | Yes | |
| "responses" | {{responses-section}} | No | |

Requirements on new assignments:

Section Names MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

Assignments must specify whether the section is parsed during
{{load-metadata}}{:format="title"} (Metadata=Yes) or not (Metadata=No).

The section's specification can use the bytes making up the section, the
bundle's stream ({{stream-operations}}), and the `sectionOffsets` map
({{load-metadata}}), as input, and MUST say if an error is returned, and
otherwise what items, if any, are added to the map that {{load-metadata}}
returns. A section's specification MAY say that, if it is present, another
section is not processed.
