--- abstract

Bundled exchanges provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP request+response
pairs to transmit or store them together. They can include multiple top-level
resources with one identified as the default by a manifest, provide random
access to their component exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.

# Introduction

To satisfy the use cases in {{?I-D.yasskin-webpackage-use-cases}}, this document
proposes a new bundling format to group HTTP resources. Several of the use cases
require the resources to be signed: that's provided by bundling signed exchanges
({{?I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses}}) rather than natively in this
format.

## Terminology

Exchange (noun)
: An HTTP request+response pair. This can either be a request from a client and
the matching response from a server or the request in a PUSH_PROMISE and its
matching response stream. Defined by Section 8 of {{!RFC7540}}.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Mode of specification {#mode}

This specification defines how conformant bundle parsers work. It does not
constrain how encoders produce a bundle: although there are some guidelines in
{{authoring-guidelines}}, encoders MAY produce any sequence of bytes that a
conformant parser would parse into the intended semantics.

This specification uses the conventions and terminology defined in the Infra
Standard ({{INFRA}}).

# Semantics {#semantics}

A bundle is logically a set of HTTP exchanges, with a URL identifying the
manifest(s) of the bundle itself.

While the order of the exchanges is not semantically meaningful, it can
significantly affect performance when the bundle is loaded from a network
stream.

A bundle is parsed from a stream of bytes, which is assumed to have the
attributes and operations described in {{stream-operations}}.

Bundle parsers support two operations,
{{semantics-load-metadata}}{:format="title"} ({{semantics-load-metadata}}) and
{{semantics-load-response}}{:format="title"} ({{semantics-load-response}}) each
of which can return an error instead of their normal result.

A client is expected to load the metadata for a bundle as soon as it starts
downloading it or otherwise discovers it. Then, when fetching ({{FETCH}}) a
request, the client is expected to match it against the requests in the
metadata, and if one matches, load that request's response.

## Stream attributes and operations {#stream-operations}

* A sequence of **available bytes**. As the stream delivers bytes, these are
  appended to the available bytes.
* An **EOF** flag that's true if the available bytes include the entire stream.
* A **current offset** within the available bytes.
* A **seek to offset N** operation to set the current offset to N bytes past the
  beginning of the available bytes. A seek past the end of the available bytes
  blocks until N bytes are available. If the stream ends before enough bytes are
  received, either due to a network error or because the stream has a finite
  length, the seek fails.
* A **read N bytes** operation, which blocks until N bytes are available past
  the current offset, and then returns them and seeks forward by N bytes. If the
  stream ends before enough bytes are received, either due to a network error or
  because the stream has a finite length, the read operation returns an error
  instead.

## Load a bundle's metadata {#semantics-load-metadata}

This takes the bundle's stream and returns a map ({{INFRA}}) of metadata
containing at least keys named:

requests

: A map ({{INFRA}}) whose keys are {{FETCH}} requests for the HTTP exchanges in
  the bundle, and whose values are opaque metadata that
  {{semantics-load-response}}{:format="title"} can use to find the matching
  response.

manifest

: The URL of the bundle's manifest(s). This is a URL to support bundles with
  multiple different manifests, where the client uses content negotiation to
  select the most appropriate one.

The map may include other items added by sections defined in the
{{section-name-registry}}{:format="title"}.

This operation only waits for a prefix of the stream that, if the bundle is
encoded with the "responses" section last, ends before the first response.

This operation's implementation is in {{load-metadata}}.

### Load a bundle's metadata from the end {#semantics-load-metadata-from-end}

If a bundle's bytes are embedded in a longer sequence rather than being
streamed, a parser can also load them starting from a pointer to the last byte
of the bundle. This returns the same data as {{semantics-load-metadata}}.

This operation's implementation is in {{from-end}}.

## Load a response from a bundle {#semantics-load-response}

This takes the sequence of bytes representing the bundle and one request
returned from {{semantics-load-metadata}} with its metadata, and returns the
response ({{FETCH}}) matching that request.

This operation can be completed without inspecting bytes other than those that
make up the loaded response, although higher-level operations like proving that
an exchange is correctly signed ({{I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses}})
may need to load other responses.

Note that this operation uses the metadata for a particular request returned by
{{semantics-load-metadata}}, while a client will generally want to load the
response for a request that the client generated. TODO: Specify how a client
determines the best available bundled response, if any, for that
client-generated request, in this or another document.

This operation's implementation is in {{load-response}}.

# Format {#format}

## Top-level structure {#top-level}

*This section is non-normative.*

A bundle holds a series of named sections. The beginning of the bundle maps
section names to the range of bytes holding that section. The most important
section is the "index" ({{index-section}}), which similarly maps serialized HTTP
requests to the range of bytes holding that request's serialized response. Byte
ranges are represented using an offset from some point in the bundle *after* the
encoding of the range itself, to reduce the amount of work needed to use the
shortest possible encoding of the range.

Future specifications can define new sections with extra data, and if necessary,
these sections can be marked "critical" ({{critical-section}}) to prevent older
parsers from using the rest of the bundle incorrectly.

The bundle is a CBOR item ({{?I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis}}) with the following CDDL
({{?I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}) schema:

~~~~~ cddl
webbundle = [
  ; üåêüì¶ in UTF-8.
  magic: h'F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6',
  section-lengths: bytes .cbor [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ],
  sections: [* any ],
  length: bytes .size 8,  ; Big-endian number of bytes in the bundle.
]

$section-name /= "index" / "manifest" / "critical" / "responses"

$section /= index / manifest / critical / responses

responses = [*response]

~~~~~

## Load a bundle's metadata {#load-metadata}

A bundle holds a series of sections, which can be accessed randomly using the
information in the `section-lengths` CBOR item, which holds a list of
alternating section names and section lengths:

~~~~~ cddl
section-lengths = [* (section-name: tstr, length: uint) ],
~~~~~

To implement {{semantics-load-metadata}}, the parser MUST run the following
steps, taking the `stream` as input.

1. Seek to offset 0 in `stream`. Assert: this operation doesn't fail.

1. If reading 10 bytes from `stream` returns an error or doesn't return the
   bytes with hex encoding "84 48 F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6" (the CBOR encoding of
   the 4-item array initial byte and 8-byte bytestring initial byte, followed by
   üåêüì¶ in UTF-8), return an error.

1. Let `sectionLengthsLength` be the result of getting the length of the CBOR
   bytestring header from `stream` ({{parse-bytestring}}). If this is an error,
   return that error.

1. If `sectionLengthsLength` is TBD or greater, return an error.

1. Let `sectionLengthsBytes` be the result of reading `sectionLengthsLength`
   bytes from `stream`. If `sectionLengthsBytes` is an error, return that error.

1. Let `sectionLengths` be the result of parsing one CBOR item ({{parse-cbor}})
   from `sectionLengthsBytes`, matching the section-lengths rule in the CDDL
   ({{!I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}) above. If `sectionLengths` is an error, return an
   error.

1. Let (`sectionsType`, `numSections`) be the result of parsing the type and
   argument of a CBOR item from `stream` ({{parse-type-argument}}).

1. If `sectionsType` is not `4` (a CBOR array) or `numSections` is not half of
   the length of `sectionLengths`, return an error.

1. Let `sectionsStart` be the current offset within `stream`.

   For example, if `sectionLengthsLength` were 52 and `sectionLengths` contained
   4 items (2 sections), `sectionsStart` would be 65 (10 initial bytes + a
   2-byte bytestring header to describe a 52-byte bytestring + 52 bytes of
   section lengths + a 1-byte array header for the 2 sections).

1. Let `knownSections` be the subset of the {{section-name-registry}} that this
   client has implemented.

1. Let `ignoredSections` be an empty set.

1. Let `sectionOffsets` be an empty map ({{INFRA}}) from section names to
   (offset, length) pairs. These offsets are relative to the start of `stream`.

1. Let `currentOffset` be `sectionsStart`.

1. For each (`"name"`, `length`) pair of adjacent elements in `sectionLengths`:
   1. If `"name"`'s specification in `knownSections` says not to process other
      sections, add those sections' names to `ignoredSections`.

      Note: The `ignoredSections` enables sections that supercede other sections
      to be introduced in the future. Implementations that don't implement any
      such sections are free to omit the relevant steps.
   1. If `sectionOffsets["name"]` exists, return an error. That is, duplicate
      sections are forbidden.
   1. Set `sectionOffsets["name"]` to (`currentOffset`, `length`).
   1. Set `currentOffset` to `currentOffset + length`.

1. If the "responses" section is not last in `sectionLengths`, return an error.
   This allows a streaming parser to assume that it'll know the requests by the
   time their responses arrive.

1. Let `metadata` be an empty map ({{INFRA}}).

1. For each `"name"` ‚Üí (`offset`, `length`) triple in `sectionOffsets`:
   1. If `"name"` isn't in `knownSections`, continue to the next triple.
   1. If `"name"`'s Metadata field ({{section-name-registry}}) is "No", continue
      to the next triple.
   1. If `"name"` is in `ignoredSections`, continue to the next triple.
   1. Seek to offset `offset` in `stream`. If this fails, return an error.
   1. Let `sectionContents` be the result of reading `length` bytes from
      `stream`. If `sectionContents` is an error, return that error.
   1. Follow `"name"`'s specification from `knownSections` to process the
      section, passing `sectionContents`, `stream`, `sectionOffsets`, and
      `metadata`. If this returns an error, return it.

1. If `metadata` doesn't have entries with keys "requests" and "manifest",
   return an error.

1. Return `metadata`.

### Parsing the index section {#index-section}

The "index" section defines the set of HTTP requests in the bundle and
identifies their locations in the "responses" section. It consists of a sequence
of alternating request headers and response lengths:

~~~ cddl
index = [* (headers, length: uint) ]
~~~

To parse the index section, given its `sectionContents`, the `sectionOffsets`
map, and the `metadata` map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `index` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the `index` rule in the above CDDL ({{parse-cbor}}). If `index` is
   an error, return an error.

1. Check that the responses array has the right number of items:
   1. Seek to offset `sectionOffsets["responses"].offset` in `stream`. If this
      fails, return an error.

   1. Let (`responsesType`, `numResponses`) be the result of parsing the type
      and argument of a CBOR item from the stream ({{parse-type-argument}}). If
      this returns an error, return that error.

   1. If `responsesType` is not `4` (a CBOR array) or `numResponses` is not half
      of the length of `index`, return an error.

1. Let `currentOffset` be the current offset within `stream` minus
   `sectionOffsets["responses"].offset`. That is, the length of the array header
   for the responses array. This will track the offset of the current response
   relative to the start of the responses array.

1. Let `requests` be an initially-empty map ({{INFRA}}) from HTTP requests
   ({{FETCH}}) to structs ({{INFRA}}) with items named "offset" and "length".

1. For each (`cbor-http-request`, `length`) pair of adjacent elements in
   `index`:
   1. Let (`headers`, `pseudos`) be the result of converting `cbor-http-request`
      to a header list and pseudoheaders using the algorithm in
      {{cbor-headers}}. If this returns an error, return that error.
   1. If `pseudos` does not have keys named ':method' and ':url', or its size
      isn't 2, return an error.
   1. If `pseudos[':method']` is not 'GET', return an error.

      Note: This could probably support any cacheable (Section 4.2.3) of
      {{!RFC7231}}) and safe (Section 4.2.1 of {{!RFC7231}}) method, matching
      PUSH_PROMISE (Section 8.2 of {{?RFC7540}}), but today that's only HEAD and
      GET, and HEAD can be served as a transformation of GET, so this version of
      the specification keeps the method simple.
   1. Let `parsedUrl` be the result of parsing ({{URL}}) `pseudos[':url']` with
      no base URL.
   1. If `parsedUrl` is a failure, its fragment is not null, or it includes
      credentials, return an error.
   1. Let `http-request` be a new request ({{FETCH}}) whose:
      * method is `pseudos[':method']`,
      * url is `parsedUrl`,
      * header list is `headers`, and
      * client is null.

   1. Let `responseOffset` be `sectionOffsets["responses"].offset +
      currentOffset`. This is relative to the start of the stream.
   1. If `currentOffset + length` is greater than
      `sectionOffsets["responses"].length`, return an error.
   1. If `requests`\[`http-request`] exists, return an error. That is, duplicate
      requests are forbidden.
   1. Set `requests`\[`http-request`] to a struct whose "offset" item is
      `responseOffset` and whose "length" item is `length`.
   1. Set `currentOffset` to `currentOffset + length`.

1. Set `metadata["requests"]` to `requests`.

### Parsing the manifest section {#manifest-section}

The "manifest" section records a single URL identifying the manifest of the
bundle. The URL MUST refer to the one or more response(s) contained in the
bundle itself.

The bundle can contain multiple resources at this URL, and the client is
expected to content-negotiate for the best one. For example, a client might
select the one with an `accept` header of `application/manifest+json`
({{appmanifest}}) and an `accept-language` header of `es-419`.

~~~ cddl
manifest = text
~~~

To parse the manifest section, given its `sectionContents` and the `metadata`
map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `urlString` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the above `manifest` rule ({{parse-cbor}}. If `urlString` is an
   error, return that error.

1. Let `url` be the result of parsing ({{URL}}) `urlString` with no base URL.

1. If `url` is a failure, its fragment is not null, or it includes credentials,
   return an error.

1. Set `metadata["manifest"]` to `url`.

### Parsing the critical section {#critical-section}

The "critical" section lists sections of the bundle that the client needs to
understand in order to load the bundle correctly. Other sections are assumed to
be optional.

~~~ cddl
critical = [*tstr]
~~~

To parse the critical section, given its `sectionContents` and the `metadata`
map to fill in, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let `critical` be the result of parsing `sectionContents` as a CBOR item
   matching the above `critical` rule ({{parse-cbor}}). If `critical` is an
   error, return that error.
1. For each value `sectionName` in the `critical` list, if the client has not
   implemented sections named `sectionName`, return an error.

This section does not modify the returned metadata.

### The responses section {#responses-section}

The responses section does not add any items to the bundle metadata map.
Instead, its offset and length are used in processing the index section
({{index-section}}).

### Starting from the end {#from-end}

The length of a bundle is encoded as a big-endian integer inside a CBOR byte
string at the end of the bundle.

~~~ ascii-art

 +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 | first byte | ... | 48 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | 00 | BC | 61 | 4E |
 +------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
             /       \
       0xBC614E-10=12345668 omitted bytes
~~~
{: title="Example trailing bytes" anchor="example-trailing-bytes"}

Parsing from the end allows the bundle to be appended to another format such as
a self-extracting executable.

To implement {{semantics-load-metadata-from-end}}, taking a sequence of bytes
`bytes`, the client MUST:

1. Let `byteStringHeader` be `bytes[bytes.length - 9]`. If `byteStringHeader is
   not `0x48` (the CBOR ({{?I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis}}) initial byte for an 8-byte
   byte string), return an error.
1. Let `bundleLength` be `[bytes[bytes.length - 8], bytes[bytes.length])` (the
   last 8 bytes) interpreted as a big-endian integer.
1. If `bundleLength > bytes.length`, return an error.
1. Let `stream` be a new stream whose:
   * Available bytes are `[bytes[bytes.length - bundleLength],
     bytes[bytes.length])`.
   * EOF flag is set.
   * Current offset is initially 0.
   * The seek to offset N and read N bytes operations succeed immediately if
     `currentOffset + N <= bundleLength` and fail otherwise.
1. Return the result of running {{load-metadata}} with `stream` as input.

## Load a response from a bundle {#load-response}

The result of {{load-metadata}}{:format="title"} maps each request to a
response, which consists of headers and a payload. The headers can be loaded
from the bundle's stream before waiting for the payload, and similarly the
payload can be streamed to downstream consumers.

~~~~~ cddl
response = [headers: bstr .cbor headers, payload: bstr]
~~~~~

To implement {{semantics-load-response}}, the parser MUST run the following
steps, taking the bundle's `stream` and one `request` and its `requestMetadata`
as returned by {{semantics-load-metadata}}.

1. Seek to offset `requestMetadata.offset` in `stream`. If this fails, return an
   error.
1. Read 1 byte from `stream`. If this is an error or isn't `0x82`, return an
   error.
1. Let `headerLength` be the result of getting the length of a CBOR bytestring
   header from `stream` ({{parse-bytestring}}). If `headerLength` is an error,
   return that error.
1. If `headerLength` is TBD or greater, return an error.
1. Let `headerCbor` be the result of reading `headerLength` bytes from `stream`
   and parsing a CBOR item from them matching the `headers` CDDL rule. If either
   the read or parse returns an error, return that error.
1. Let (`headers`, `pseudos`) be the result of converting `headerCbor` to a
   header list and pseudoheaders using the algorithm in {{cbor-headers}}. If
   this returns an error, return that error.
1. If `pseudos` does not have a key named ':status' or its size isn't 1, return
   an error.
1. If `pseudos[':status']` isn't exactly 3 ASCII decimal digits, return an
   error.

1. Let `payloadLength` be the result of getting the length of a CBOR bytestring
   header from `stream` ({{parse-bytestring}}). If `payloadLength` is an error,
   return that error.
1. If `stream.currentOffset + payloadLength != requestMetadata.offset +
   requestMetadata.length`, return an error.

1. Let `body` be a new body ({{FETCH}}) whose stream is a tee'd copy of `stream`
   starting at the current offset and ending after `payloadLength` bytes.

   TODO: Add the rest of the details of creating a `ReadableStream` object.

1. Let `response` be a new response ({{FETCH}}) whose:
   * Url list is `request`'s url list,
   * status is `pseudos[':status']`,
   * header list is `headers`, and
   * body is `body`.

1. Return `response`.

## Parsing CBOR items {#parse-cbor}

Parsing a bundle involves parsing many CBOR items. All of these items need to be
canonically encoded.

### Parse a known-length item {#parse-known-length}

To parse a CBOR item ({{!I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis}}), optionally matching a CDDL
rule ({{!I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}), from a sequence of bytes, `bytes`, the parser
MUST do the following:

1. If `bytes` are not a well-formed CBOR item, return an error.
1. If `bytes` does not satisfy the core canonicalization requirements from
   Section 4.9 of {{!I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis}}, return an error. This format does
   not use floating point values or tags, so this specification does not add any
   canonicalization rules for them.
1. If `bytes` includes extra bytes after the encoding of a CBOR item, return an
   error.
1. Let `item` be the result of decoding `bytes` as a CBOR item.
1. If a CDDL rule was specified, but `item` does not match it, return an error.
1. Return `item`.

### Parsing variable-length data from a bytestring {#parse-bytestring}

Bundles encode variable-length data in CBOR bytestrings, which are prefixed with
their length. This algorithm returns the number of bytes in the variable-length
item and sets the stream's current offset to  the first byte of the contents.

To get the length of a CBOR bytestring header from a bundle's stream, the parser MUST do the following:

1. Let (`type`, `argument`) be the result of parsing the type and argument of a
   CBOR item from the stream ({{parse-type-argument}}). If this returns an
   error, return that error.
1. If `type` is not `2`, the item is not a bytestring. Return an error.
1. Return `argument`.

### Parsing the type and argument of a CBOR item {#parse-type-argument}

To parse the type and argument of a CBOR item from a bundle's stream, the parser
MUST do the following. This algorithm returns a pair of the CBOR major type 0--7
inclusive, and a 64-bit integral argument for the CBOR item:

1. Let `firstByte` be the result of reading 1 byte from the stream. If
   `firstByte` is an error, return that error.
1. Let `type` be `(firstByte & 0xE0) / 0x20`.
1. If `firstByte & 0x1F` is:

   0..23, inclusive
   : Return (`type`, `firstByte & 0x1F`).

   24
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 1 byte from the stream. If `content`
     is an error or is less than 24, return an error.

   25
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 2 bytes from the stream. If
     `content` is an error or its first byte is 0, return an error.

   26
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 4 bytes from the stream. If
     `content` is an error or its first two bytes are 0, return an error.

   27
   : Let `content` be the result of reading 8 bytes from the stream. If
     `content` is an error or its first four bytes are 0, return an error.

   28..31, inclusive
   : Return an error.

     Note: This intentionally does not support indefinite-length items.
1. Let `argument` be the big-endian integer encoded in `content`.
1. Return (`type`, `argument`).

## Interpreting CBOR HTTP headers {#cbor-headers}

Bundles represent HTTP requests and responses as a list of headers, matching the
following CDDL ({{!I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl}}):

~~~ cddl
headers = {* bstr => bstr}
~~~

Pseudo-headers starting with a `:` provide the non-header information needed to
create a request or response as appropriate

To convert a CBOR item `item` into a {{FETCH}} header list and pseudoheaders,
parsers MUST do the following:

1. If `item` doesn't match the `headers` rule in the above CDDL, return an
   error.
1. Let `headers` be a new header list ({{FETCH}}).
1. Let `pseudos` be an empty map ({{INFRA}}).

1. For each pair (`name`, `value`) in `item`:
   1. If `name` contains any upper-case or non-ASCII characters, return an
      error. This matches the requirement in Section 8.1.2 of {{?RFC7540}}.
   1. If `name` starts with a ':':
      1. Assert: `pseudos[name]` does not exist, because CBOR maps cannot
         contain duplicate keys.
      1. Set `pseudos[name]` to `value`.
      1. Continue.
   1. If `name` or `value` doesn't satisfy the requirements for a header in
      {{FETCH}}, return an error.
   1. Assert: `headers` does not contain ({{FETCH}}) `name`, because CBOR maps
      cannot contain duplicate keys and an earlier step rejected upper-case
      bytes.

      Note: This means that a response cannot set more than one cookie, because
      the `Set-Cookie` header ({{?RFC6265}}) has to appear multiple times to set
      multiple cookies.
   1. Append (`name`, `value`) to `headers`.

1. Return (`headers`, `pseudos`).

# Guidelines for bundle authors {#authoring-guidelines}

Bundles SHOULD consist of a single CBOR item satisfying the core
canonicalization requirements ({{parse-cbor}}) and matching the `webbundle` CDDL
rule in {{top-level}}.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Bundles currently have no mechanism for ensuring that the signed exchanges they
contain constitute a consistent version of those resources. Even if a website
never has a security vulnerability when resources are fetched at a single time,
an attacker might be able to combine a set of resources pulled from different
versions of the website to build a vulnerable site. While the vulnerable site
could have occurred by chance on a client's machine due to normal HTTP caching,
bundling allows an attacker to guarantee that it happens. Future work in this
specification might allow a bundle to constrain its resources to come from a
consistent version.

# IANA considerations

## Internet Media Type Registration

IANA maintains the registry of Internet Media Types {{?RFC6838}}
at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>.

* Type name: application

* Subtype name: webbundle

* Required parameters: N/A

* Optional parameters: N/A

* Encoding considerations: binary

* Security considerations: See {{security}} of this document.

* Interoperability considerations: N/A

* Published specification: This document

* Applications that use this media type: None yet, but it is expected that web
     browsers will use this format.

* Fragment identifier considerations: N/A

* Additional information:

  * Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
  * Magic number(s): 84 48 F0 9F 8C 90 F0 9F 93 A6
  * File extension(s): .wbn
  * Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

* Person & email address to contact for further information:
  See the Author's Address section of this specification.

* Intended usage: COMMON

* Restrictions on usage: N/A

* Author:
  See the Author's Address section of this specification.

* Change controller:
  The IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

* Provisional registration? (standards tree only): Not yet.

## Web Bundle Section Name Registry {#section-name-registry}

IANA is directed to create a new registry with the following attributes:

Name: Web Bundle Section Names

Review Process: Specification Required

Initial Assignments:

| Section Name | Specification | Metadata |
| "index" | {{index-section}} | Yes |
| "manifest" | {{manifest-section}} | Yes |
| "critical" | {{critical-section}} | Yes |
| "responses" | {{responses-section}} | No |

Requirements on new assignments:

Section Names MUST be encoded in UTF-8.

Assignments must specify whether the section is parsed during
{{load-metadata}}{:format="title"} (Metadata=Yes) or not (Metadata=No).

The section's specification can use the bytes making up the section, the
bundle's stream ({{stream-operations}}), and the `sectionOffsets` map
({{load-metadata}}), as input, and MUST say if an error is returned, and
otherwise what items, if any, are added to the map that {{load-metadata}}
returns. A section's specification MAY say that, if it is present, another
section is not processed.

# Change Log

RFC EDITOR PLEASE DELETE THIS SECTION.

draft-01

* Order the index in the same order as the responses, and require responses to
  be sequential without gaps.
* "manifest" needs to be embedded into the bundle.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Chrome loading team, especially Kinuko Yasuda and Kouhei Ueno for
making the format work well when streamed.
